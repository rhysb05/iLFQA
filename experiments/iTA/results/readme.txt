	Description:
	Contains results of multi_question test where the two highest scored paragraphs
	accoording to the confidence scores generated by an LSTM model are passed to a BART
	model pre-trained on the ELI5 dataset. These results contain 115 total questions. This
	test was done as a baseline to determine how the original implemntation of iTA would perform
	with added textbooks and more questions. The source code is the same, the questions 
	have been altered from the oroginal implemntation:
	
	answer, time_dict, context = res.get_response(d[0])
