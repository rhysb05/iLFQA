1 INTRODUCTION 1 

1 Introduction 

1.1 What is Direct Energy Conversion? 
Energy conversion devices convert between electrical, magnetic, kinetic, potential, 
optical, chemical, nuclear, and other forms of energy. Energy conversion 
processes occur naturally. For example, energy is converted from 
optical electromagnetic radiation to heat when sunlight warms a house, 
and energy is converted from potential energy to kinetic energy when a 
leaf falls from a tree. Alternatively, energy conversion devices are designed 
and manufactured by a wide range of scientists and engineers. These energy 
conversion devices range from tiny integrated circuit components such 
as thermocouples which are used to sense temperature by converting microwatts 
of power from thermal energy to electricity to enormous coal power 
plants which convert gigawatts of energy stored in the chemical bonds of 
coal into electricity. 

A direct energy conversion device converts one form of energy to another 
through a single process. For example, a solar cell is a direct energy 
conversion device that converts optical electromagnetic radiation to electricity. 
While some of the sunlight that falls on a solar cell may heat it up 
instead, that effect is not fundamental to the solar cell operation. Alternatively, 
indirect energy conversion devices involve a series of direct energy 
conversion processes. For example, some solar power plants involve converting 
optical electromagnetic radiation to electricity by heating a uid 
so that it evaporates. The evaporation and expansion of the gas spin a 
rotor of a turbine. The energy from the mechanical motion of the rotor is 
converted to a time varying magnetic field which is then converted to an 
alternating electrical current in the coils of the generator. 

This text focuses on direct energy conversion devices which convert between 
electrical energy and another form. Because of the wide variety of 
devices that fit in this category, energy conversion is a topic important 
to all types of electrical engineers. Some electrical engineers specialize 
in building instrumentation systems. Many sensors used by these engineers 
are direct energy conversion devices, including strain gauges used to 
measure pressure, Hall effect sensors which measure magnetic field, and 
piezoelectric sensors used to detect mechanical vibrations. The electrical 
energy produced in a sensor may be so small that amplification is required. 
Other electrical engineers specialize in the production and distribution of 
electrical power. Batteries and solar cells are direct energy conversion devices 
used to store and generate electricity. They are particularly useful 
in remote locations or in hand held gadgets where there is no easy way

to connect to the power grid. Relatedly, direct energy conversion devices 
such as thermoelectric devices and fuel cells are used to power satellites, 
rovers, and other aerospace systems. Many electrical engineers work in 
the automotive industry. Direct energy conversion devices found in cars 
include batteries, optical cameras, Hall effect sensors in tachometer used 
to measure rotation speed, and pressure sensors. 

Direct energy conversion is a fascinating topic because it does not fit 
neatly into a single discipline. Energy conversion is fundamental to the 
fields of electrical engineering, but it is also fundamental to mechanical 
engineering, physics, chemistry, and other branches of science and engineering. 
For example, springs are energy storage devices often studied by 
mechanical engineers, capacitors are energy storage devices often studied 
by electrical engineers, and batteries are energy storage devices often studied 
by chemists. Relatedly, energy storage and energy conversion devices, 
such as springs, capacitors, and batteries, are not esoteric. They are commonplace, 
cheap, and widely available. While they are found in everyday 
objects, they are active subjects of contemporary research too. For example, 
laptop computers are limited by the lifetime of batteries, and cell phone 
reception is often limited by the quality of an antenna. Batteries, antennas, 
and other direct energy conversion devices are studied by both consumer 
companies trying to build better products and academic researchers trying 
to understand fundamental physics. 

1.2 Preview of Topics 
This book is intended to both illustrate individual energy conversion technologies 
and illuminate the relationship between them. For this reason, it 
is organized in two parts. The first part is a survey of energy conversion 
processes. The second part introduces calculus of variations and uses it as 
a framework to relate energy conversion processes. 

Due to the wide variety, it is not possible to discuss all energy conversion 
devices, even all direct devices, in detail. However, by studying the example 
direct energy conversion processes, we can gain an understanding of indirect 
processes and other applications. The devices discussed in this book 
involve energy conversion between electrical form and another form. Additionally, 
devices involving magnets and coils will not be discussed. Many 
useful devices, including motors, generators, wind turbines, and geothermal 
power plants, convert energy electromagnetically using magnets and coils. 
Approximately 90% of power supplied to the electrical grid in the United 
States comes from generators that use magnets and coils [1]. Also, about 
2/3 to 3/4 of energy used by manufacturing facilities goes towards motors 

 
1 INTRODUCTION 3 

[2, ch. 1]. However, plenty of good resources discussing these topics exist. 
Furthermore, this book emphasizes device that operate near room temperature 
and at relatively low power (<1 kW). Many interesting devices, such 
as nuclear power plants, operate at high temperatures. One reason not to 
discuss more powerful devices is that the vast majority of large electrical 
generators in use today involve turbines with coils and magnets. Another 
reason is that these devices are often limited by material considerations. 
Finding materials to construct high temperature devices is a challenging 
problem, but it is not the purpose of this book. Additionally, only technologies 
commercially available on the market today are discussed in this book. 
Also, many quality texts exist on the topics of renewable and alternative 
energy sources. For this reason, this book will not focus on renewable or 
alternative energy technologies. Topics like wind turbines, which involve 
electromechanical energy conversion with magnets and coils, are not discussed. 
Solar cells, piezoelectric devices, and other direct energy conversion 
devices are discussed and can be considered both direct energy conversion 
devices and renewable energy devices. 

While a few books on direct energy conversion exist, there are few 
things which set this book apart. First, many of the books on direct energy 
conversion, including [3] and [4], are written at the graduate level 
while this book is aimed at a more general audience. This book is used 
for the course Direct Energy Conversion taught at Trine University, which 
is a junior undergraduate level course for electrical engineers. This book 
is not intended only for electrical engineering students. It is also aimed 
at researchers who are interested in how energy conversion is studied by 
scientists and engineers in other disciplines. The idea of energy conversion 
is fundamental to physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering, and multiple 
other disciplines. This book discusses fundamental physics behind energy 
conversion processes, introduces terminology used, and relates concepts of 
material science used for building devices. The chapters were written so 
that someone who is not an antenna designer, for example, can read the 
relevant chapter as an introduction and gain insights into some of the terminology 
and key concepts used by electromagnetics researchers. Second, 
a number of good books on the topic, including [3] and [5] were written 
decades ago. The concepts of these books remain relevant, and these books 
often predicted which technologies would be of interest. However, there is 
a need for a book which discusses the most accessible and commonplace 
direct energy conversion technologies in use today. Additionally, many of 
these classic texts are out of print, and contemporary texts are needed. 

The reader is assumed to be familiar with introductory chemistry and 
physics. Background in electrical circuits and materials may also be helpful. 

 
4 1.2 Preview of Topics 
Math through Calculus I is used in the first part of the book, and math 
through Calculus III (including partial derivatives) is used in the second 
part. Many topics in this text are discussed qualitatively. No attempt 
is made to be mathematically rigorous, and proofs are not given. The 
physics of devices is emphasized over excessive mathematics. Additionally, 
all physical systems will be discussed semiclassically, which means that 
explanations will involve electrons and electromagnetic fields, but the wave-
particle duality of these quantities will not be discussed. While quantum 
mechanical, quantum field theoretical, and other more precise theories exist 
to describe many physical situations, semiclassical discussions will be used 
to make this book more easily accessible to readers without a background 
in quantum mechanics. 

Chapters 2 -10 comprise the first part of this book. As mentioned 
above, they survey various direct energy conversion processes which convert 
to or from electricity and which do not involve magnets and coils. Table 

1.1 lists many of the processes studied along with where in the text they 
are discussed, and Table 1.2 lists some of the devices detailed. This text 
is not intended to be encyclopedic or complete. Instead, it is intended 
to highlight the physics behind some of the most widely available and 
accessible energy conversion devices which convert to or from electrical 
energy. One way to understand energy conversion devices used to convert 
to or from electricity is to classify them as most similar to capacitors, 
inductors, resistors, or diodes. While not all devices fit neatly in these 
categories, many do. The second column of Table 1.2 lists the category for 
various devices. Similarly, energy conversion processes may be capacitive, 
inductive, resistive, or diode-like. 
Capacitive energy conversion processes are discussed in Chapters 2 and 

3. Capacitors, piezoelectric devices, pyroelectric devices, and electro-optic 
devices are discussed. A piezoelectric device is a device which converts 
mechanical energy directly to electricity or converts electricity directly to 
mechanical energy [6] [3]. A material polarization and voltage develop 
when the piezoelectric device is compressed. A pyroelectric device converts 
a temperature differential into electricity [6]. The change in temperature 
induces a material polarization and a voltage in the material. Electro-optic 
devices convert an optical electromagnetic field to energy of a material polarization. 
In these devices, an external optical field typically from a laser 
induces a material polarization and a voltage across the material. Chapters 
4 and 5 discuss inductive energy conversion devices including antennas, 
Hall effect devices, and magnetohydrodynamic devices. An antenna converts 
electrical energy to an electromagnetic field or vice versa. A Hall 
effect device converts a magnetic field to or from electricity. A magnetohy

drodynamic device converts kinetic energy of a conducting material in the 
presence of a magnetic field into electricity. 

Optical devices are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. These chapters discuss 
devices made from diode-like pn junctions such as solar cells, LEDs, 
and semiconductor lasers as well as other types of devices such as incandescent 
lamps and gas lasers. Thermoelectric devices convert a temperature 
differential into electricity [3, p. 146]. They are also made from junctions 
of materials in which heat and charges ow at different rates, and they are 
discussed in Chapter 8. Batteries and fuel cells are discussed in Chapter 9. 
A battery is a device which stores energy as a chemical potential. Batteries 
range in size from tiny hearing aid button sized batteries which store tens 
of milliamp-hours of charge to large car batteries which can store 10,000 
times as much energy. A fuel cell is a device which converts chemical energy 
to electrical energy through the oxidation of a fuel [3]. During battery 
operation, the electrodes are consumed, and during fuel cell operation, the 
fuel and oxidizer are consumed instead. A variety of resistor-like energy 
conversion devices, among other devices, are discussed briey in Chapter 
10. 

Chapters 11 -14 comprise the second part of this book. These chapters 
are more theoretical, and they establish a mathematical framework for understanding 
energy conversion. This mathematics allows relationships to 
be studied between energy conversion devices built by electrical engineers, 
mechanical engineers, chemists, and scientists of other disciplines. Chapters 
11 and 12 introduce the idea of calculus of variations and apply it to 
a wide variety of energy conversion processes. Chapter 13 applies the idea 
of calculus of variations to energy conversion within an individual atom. 
Chapter 14 shows how a study of the symmetries of the equations produced 
from calculus of variations can provide further insights into energy 
conversion processes. 

 
1 INTRODUCTION 9 

1.3 Conservation of Energy 
Energy conservation is one of the most fundamental ideas in all of science 
and engineering. Energy can be converted from one form to another. 
For example, kinetic energy of a moving ball can be converted to heat by 
friction, or it can be converted to potential energy if the ball rolls up a 
hill. However, energy cannot be created or destroyed. The idea of energy 
conservation will be considered an axiom, and it will not be questioned 
throughout this book. Sometimes people use somewhat loose language 
when describing energy conversion. For example, one might say that energy 
is lost to friction when a moving block slides along a table or when 
electricity ows through a resistor. In both cases, the energy is not lost 
but is instead converted to heat. Thermoelectric devices and pyroelectric 
devices can convert a temperature differential back to electricity. Someone 
might say that energy is generated by a coal power plant. What this phrase 
means is that chemical energy stored in the coal is converted to electrical 
energy. When a battery is charged, electrical energy is converted back to 
chemical energy. This imprecise language will occasionally be used in the 
text, but in all cases, energy conservation is assumed. While it might seem 
like an abstract theoretical law, energy conservation is used regularly by circuit 
designers, mechanical engineers modeling mechanisms, civil engineers 
designing pipe systems, and other types of engineers. 

Efficiency of an energy conversion device, eff 
, is defined as the power 
output of the desired energy type over the power input. 

Pout

eff 
= 
(1.1)
Pin 


Efficiency may be written as a fraction or a percent. For example, if we say 
that an energy conversion device is 75% efficient, we mean that 75% of the 
energy is converted from the first form to the second while the remaining 
energy either remains in the first form or is converted to other undesired 
forms of energy. Energy conversion devices are rarely 100% efficient, and 
some commercial energy conversion devices are only a few percent efficient. 
Multiple related measures of efficiency exist where the input and output 
powers are chosen slightly differently. To accurately compare efficiency 
measures of devices, consistent of input and output power must be used. 

 
10 1.4 Measures of Power and Energy 
1.4 Measures of Power and Energy 
This book brings together topics from a range of fields including chemistry, 
electrical engineering, and thermodynamics. Scientists in each branch of 
study use symbols to represent specific quantities, and the choice of variables 
by scientists in one field often contradict the choice by scientists in 
another field. In this text, different fonts are used to represent different 
symbols. For example, S 
represents entropy, $ 
represents the Seebeck coe
fficient, and S 
represents action. A list of variables used in this text along 
with their units can be found in Appendix A. Use the tables in the appendix 
as tools. 

Power P 
and energy E 
are fundamental measures. Power absorbed by 
a system is the derivative of the energy absorbed with respect to time.

In SI units, energy is measured in joules and power is measured in watts. 
While these are the most common measures, many other units are used. 
Every industry, from the petroleum industry to the food industry to the 
electrical power industry, seems to have its own favorite units. Tables 1.3 
and 1.4 list energy and power conversion factors. Values in the tables are 
from references [7] and [8]. 

Conversions between joules and some units, including calories, ergs, 
kilowatt hours, and tons of TNT are exact definitions [7]. The calorie 
is approximately the energy needed to increase the temperature of one 
gram of water by a temperature of one degree Celsius, but it is defined to 
be 4:1868 
J [7]. Note that there is both a calorie and food calorie (also 
called kilocalorie). The food calorie or kilocalorie is typically used when 
specifying the energy content of foods, and it is a thousand times as large 
as the (lowercase c) calorie. Other conversions listed in Table 1.3, including 
the conversion for energy in barrels of crude oil, are approximate average 
values instead of exact definitions [8]. Values in Table 1.3 are listed to 
the significant precision known or to four significant digits. Other inexact 
values throughout this text are also specified to four significant digits. The 
unit cm 
1 
, referred to as wave number, is discussed in Ch. 6. The conversion 
value listed in Table 1.3 for the therm is the US, not European, accepted 
value [7]. A barrel, used in the measure of crude oil, is 42 US gallons [8].

12 1.5 Properties of Materials 
1.5 Properties of Materials 
1.5.1 Macroscopic Properties 
To understand energy conversion devices, we need to understand materials 
both microscopically on the atomic scale and macroscopically on large 
scales. A macroscopic property is a property that applies to large pieces of 
the material as opposed to microscopic sized pieces. 

One way to classify materials is based on their state of matter. Materials 
can be classified as solids, liquids, gases, or plasmas. A plasma is an ionized 
gas. Other more unusual states of matter exist such as Bose Einstein 
condensates, but they will not be discussed in this book. 

CrystallineAmorphousPolycrystalline
Figure 1.1: Illustration of crystalline, amorphous, and polycrystalline 
atomic structure. 

We can further classify solids as crystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous 
based on the regularity of their atomic structure [9]. Figure 1.1 
illustrates these terms. In a crystal, the arrangement of atoms is periodic. 
The atoms may be arranged in a cubic array, hexagonal array, or some other 
way, but they are arranged periodically in three dimensions. In an amorphous 
material, the arrangement of the atoms is not periodic. The term 
amorphous means glassy. A polycrystalline material is composed of small 
crystalline regions. These definitions can apply to materials made of single 
elements or materials made of multiple elements. Many energy conversion 
devices are made from very pure crystalline, amorphous, or polycrystalline 
materials. For example, amorphous cadmium telluride is used to make solar 
cells, and crystalline silicon is used to make Hall effect devices. Many 
materials, including both silicon and silicon dioxide, can be found in all 
three of these forms at room temperature. In crystalline and amorphous 
silicon, for example, the silicon atoms may have the same number of nearest 
neighbors, and the density of atoms in both materials may be the same, 
but there is no medium-range order in the amorphous material. Electrical 
properties of crystalline, amorphous, and polycrystalline forms of a mate

rial may differ. Electrons can flow more easily through a pure crystalline 
material while electrons are more likely to be scattered or absorbed as they 
flow through an amorphous material, crystalline materials with impurities, 
or a crystalline material with crystal defects. 

We can further classify crystals as either isotropic or anisotropic [10, 

p. 210]. A crystal is isotropic if its macroscopic structure and material 
properties are the same in each direction. A crystal is anisotropic if the 
macroscopic structure and material properties are different in different directions. 
We can also classify materials based on how they behave when a voltage 
is applied across the material [11]. In a conductor, electrons flow easily 
in the presence of an applied voltage or electric field. In an insulator, 
also called a dielectric, electrons do not flow in the presence of an applied 
voltage or electric field. In the presence of a small external voltage or 
electric field, a semiconductor acts as an insulator, and in the presence of a 
strong voltage or electric field, a semiconductor acts as a conductor. Both 
solids and liquids can be conductors, and both solids and liquids can be 
insulators. For example, copper is a solid conductor while salt water is a 
liquid conductor. 

1.5.2 Microscopic Properties 
The electron configuration lists the energy levels occupied by electrons 
around an atom. The electron configuration can describe neutral or ionized 
atoms, and it can describe atoms in the lowest energy state or excited 
atoms. For example, the electron configuration of a neutral aluminum atom 
in the lowest energy state is 1s22s22p63s23p1 
. The electron configuration 
of an aluminum Al+ 
ion in the lowest energy state is 1s22s22p63s2 
, and the 
electron configuration of a neutral aluminum atom with an excited electron 
can be written as 1s22s22p63s24s1 
. 

Electrons are labeled by four quantum numbers: the principle quantum 
number, the azimuthal quantum number, the magnetic quantum number, 
and the spin quantum number [6] [12]. No two electrons around an atom 
can have the same set of quantum numbers. The principle quantum number 
takes integer values, 1, 2, 3 and so on. All electrons with the same principle 
quantum number are said to be in the same shell. The large numbers in 
the electron configuration refer to principle quantum numbers. The neutral 
aluminum atom in the lowest energy state has two electrons in the 1 shell, 
eight electrons in the 2 shell, and three electrons in the 3 shell. For most 
atoms, especially atoms with few electrons, electrons with lower principle 
quantum numbers both are spatially closer to the nucleus and require the 

 
14 1.5 Properties of Materials 
most energy to remove. However, there are exceptions to this idea for some 
electrons around larger atoms [13] [14]. 

Azimuthal quantum numbers are integers, and these values define sub-
shells. For shells with principle quantum number n 
, the azimuthal quantum 
number can take values from 0 to n􀀀1. In the electron configuration, values 
of this quantum number are denoted by lowercase letters: s=0, p=1, d=2, 
f=3, and so on. Magnetic quantum numbers are also integers, and these 
values define orbitals. For a subshell with azimuthal quantum number l, 
the magnetic quantum number takes values from 􀀀l 
to l. In the electron 
configuration, superscript numbers indicate the magnetic quantum number. 
Spin quantum numbers of electrons can take the values 12 
and − 
21 
. 
They are not explicitly denoted in the electron configuration. 

Consider again the neutral aluminum atom in the lowest energy state. 
This atom has electrons with principle quantum numbers n=1, 2, and 3. 
For electrons with principle quantum number 1, the only possible values for 
both the azimuthal quantum number and the magnetic quantum number 
are zero. The spin quantum number can take the values of 12 
and − 
21 
. Only 
two electrons can occupy the 1 shell, and these electrons are denoted by 
the 1s2 
term of the electron configuration. For the electrons with principle 
quantum number 2, the azimuthal quantum number can be 0 or 1. Two 
electrons can occupy the 2s orbital, and six electrons can occupy the 2p 
orbital. For the 3 shell, the azimuthal quantum number can take three 
possible values: s=0, p=1, and d=2. However since aluminum only has 13 
electrons, electrons do not have all of these possible values, so the 3 shell 
is only partially filled. The atoms in the rightmost column of the periodic 
table have completely filled shells. They are rarely involved in chemical 
reactions because adding electrons, removing electrons, or forming chemical 
bonds would require too much energy. 

Valence electrons are the electrons that are most easily ripped off an 
atom. Valence electrons are the electrons involved in chemical reactions, 
and electrical current is the flow of valence electrons. Other, inner shell, 
electrons may be involved in chemical reactions or electrical current only in 
cases of unusually large applied energies, and these situations will not be 
discussed in this text. Valence electrons occupy the subshell or subshells 
with the highest quantum numbers, and valence electrons are not part of 
completely filled shells. For the example of the neutral aluminum atom 
in the lowest energy state, the three electrons in the 3 shell are valence 
electrons. 

Where are the electrons around the atom spatially? This question is 
of interest to chemists, physicists, and electrical engineers. If we know the 
orbital of an electron, we have some information on where the electron 

 
1 INTRODUCTION 15 

is likely to be found spatially around an atom. However, identifying the 
location of an electron with any degree of precision is difficult for multiple 
reasons. First, atoms are tiny, roughly 10􀀀10 
m in diameter. Second, at 
any temperature above absolute zero, atoms and electrons are continually 
in motion. Third, electrons have both particle-like and wave-like properties. 
Fourth, according to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the position and 
momentum of an electron cannot simultaneously be known with complete 
precision. At best, you can say that an electron is most likely in some 
region and moves with some range of speed. Fifth, in many materials 
including conductors and semiconductors, valence electrons are shared by 
many atoms instead of bound to an individual atom [10, p. 544]. 

1.6 Electromagnetic Waves 
1.6.1 Maxwell's Equations 
In this text, V 
and I 
denote DC voltage and current respectively while v 
and i 
denote AC or time varying voltage and current. In circuit analysis, 
we are unconcerned with what happens outside these wires. We are only 
interested in node voltages and currents through wires. Furthermore, the 
voltages and currents in the circuit are described as functions of time t 
but not position (x, 
y, 
z). Devices like resistors, capacitors, and inductors 
too are assumed to be point-like and not extended with respect to position 
(x, 
y, 
z). This set of assumptions is just a model. In reality, if two nodes in 
a circuit have a voltage difference between them, then necessarily a force 

 


is exerted on nearby charges not in the path of the circuit. This force per 

 


unit charge is the electric field intensity E 
. Similarly, if there is current 
flowing through a wire, there is necessarily a force exerted on electrons in 

!

nearby loops of wire, and this force per unit current element is the magnetic 

 


flux density B 
. Energy can be stored in an electric or magnetic field. In 
later chapters, we will discuss devices, including antennas, electro-optic 
devices, photovoltaic devices, lamps, and lasers, that convert energy of an 
electromagnetic field to or from electricity. 

Four interrelated vector quantities are used to describe electromagnetic 
fields. These vector fields are functions of position (x,

per meter, and it is discussed further in Sections 1.6.3 and 2.2.3. The 
quantity r

is a unit

1.6.3 Electromagnetic Waves in Materials 

Electromagnetic fields interact very differently with conductors and with 
insulators. Electromagnetic fields do not propagate into perfect conductors. 
Instead, charges and currents accumulate on the surface. While no 
materials are perfect conductors, commonly encountered metals like copper 
and aluminum are very good conductors. When these materials are 
placed in an external electromagnetic field, surface charges and currents 
build up, and the electromagnetic field in the material quickly approaches 
zero. Electromagnetic fields propagate through perfect insulators for long 
distances without decaying, and no charges or currents can accumulate 
on the surface because there are no electrons free from their atoms. In 
practical dielectrics, electromagnetic waves propagate long distances with 
very little attenuation. For example, optical electromagnetic waves remain 
strong enough to detect after propagating hundreds of kilometers through 
optical fibers made of pure silicon dioxide [10, p. 886]. 

Resistance R 
in ohms, capacitance C 
in farads, and inductance L 
in 
henries describe the electrical properties of devices. Resistivity ρ 
in 
m, 
permittivity 
in mF , and permeability µ 
in H describe the electrical prop-

m 

erties of materials. The quantities , 
, 
and µ 
describe properties of materials 
alone while the quantities R, 
C, and L 
incorporate effects the material, 
shape, and size of a device. 

Resistivity ρ 
is a measure of the inability of charges or electromagnetic 
waves to propagate through a material. Conductors have a very small 
resistivity while insulators have a large resistivity. Sometimes electrical 
conductivity, σ 
= 
ρ 
1 
in units 

1 
m, is used in place of the resistivity. For a 
device made of a uniform material with length l 
and cross sectional area 
A, 
resistance and resistivity are related by

Resistance is a measure of the inability of charges or electromagnetic waves

Some insulators have a permittivity hundreds of times larger than the permittivity 
of free space. Permittivity is a measure of ability to store energy 
in a material while capacitance is a measure of the ability to store energy 
in in a device.

Permittivity, permeability, and resistivity, depend on frequency. In 
some contexts, the frequency dependence can be ignored, and throughout 
most of this text, these quantities will be assumed to be constants. 
In other contexts, the frequency dependence can be quite significant. For 
example, the permittivity of semiconductor materials is a strong function 
of frequency for frequencies close to the semiconductor energy gap. The 
permittivity (!) 
and resistivity (!) 
are not independent. If one of them is 
known as a function of frequency and µ 
is assumed constant, the other can 
be derived. This relationship is known as the Kramers Kronig relationship 

[10] or occasionally as the dielectric dispersion formula [15]. 
When discussing electrical properties of a device, resistance, inductance, 
and capacitance are combined into one complex measure, the impedance. 
Similarly, some authors find it convenient to combine resistivity, permittivity, 
and permeability into a pair of complex measures of the electrical 
properties of materials [6]. The complex permittivity is defined ∗ 
= 
+ 
j, 
and the complex permeability is defined µ 
∗ 
= 
µ 
+ 
jmag 
. The quantity 
ρ 
represents the resistivity which is a measure of the energy converted to 
heat as a charge flows through a material due to an applied electrical field. 
The quantity mag 
represents an analogous measure of energy converted to 
heat from currents in an applied magnetic field. Complex permittivity and 
permeability will not be used in this text.

2 Capacitors and Piezoelectric Devices 

2.1 Introduction 
This chapter begins with a discussion of material polarization, and then it 
discusses capacitors and piezoelectric devices. The next chapter discusses 
pyroelectric devices and electro-optic devices. All of these devices are all 
constructed from a thin dielectric layer, and operation of all of these devices 
involves establishing a material polarization, charge build up, throughout 
this dielectric material. In piezoelectric materials, mechanical strain causes 
a material polarization. As with many energy conversion devices, piezoelectric 
devices can work both ways, converting mechanical energy to electricity 
or converting electricity to mechanical vibrations. In pyroelectric devices, a 
temperature gradient causes the material polarization, and in electro-optic 
devices, an external optical electric field causes the material polarization. 

Why start the discussion of energy conversion devices with a discussion 
of capacitors? Capacitors are familiar to electrical engineers, and they are 
energy storage devices. How do capacitors work? What are the components 
of a capacitor? What materials are capacitors made out of? What are the 
differences between different types of capacitors such as mica capacitors 
and electrolytic capacitors? In an introductory circuits course, a capacitor 
is a device where the relationship between the current i 
and voltage v 
is 
given by 

dv 


i 
= 
C 
(2.1)

dt 


and the capacitance C 
is just a constant. The only difference between one 
capacitor and another is the capacitance value. In order to answer these 
questions further, we need to go beyond this model. Through this study, 
we will gain insights into piezoelectric devices, pyroelectric devices, and 
electro-optic devices too. 

 
24 2.2 Capacitors 

2.2 Capacitors 
2.2.1 Material Polarization 
When an external voltage is applied across an insulator, charges separate 
throughout the material, and this charge separation is called a material 
polarization. Material polarization can be defined more precisely in terms 

 


 


of the electric field intensity E 
and the displacement flux density D, two 
vector fields which show up in Maxwell's equations, Eqs. 1.5 -1.8. These 
vector fields are related by 

 


 


D 
= 
E. 
(2.2) 

Why do we define two electric field parameters when they are just scaled 
versions of each other? It is useful to separate the description of the electric 
field inside a material from the description of the field in free space. 
Similarly, two vector fields describe magnetic field, the magnetic field inten


 


 


sity H 
and magnetic flux densityB 
, and these fields show up in Maxwell's 



 


equations for the same reason. Material polarization, P 
in units mC 
2 
, is 



 


defined as the difference between the electric field in the material D 
and



 


the electric field that would be present in free space E. 
More specifically,

or

E. 
(2.4) 

These expressions involve the permittivity of free space 0 
and the permittivity 
of a material 
which were defined in Sec. 1.6.3. 

Scientists overload both the words capacitance and polarization with 
multiple meanings. See Appendix C for more details on the different uses 
of these terms. 

2.2.2 Energy Storage in Capacitors 
When a capacitor is charged, energy is converted from electrical energy to 
energy stored in a material polarization which is energy of the charge separation. 
When it is discharged, energy is converted from energy stored in 
the material polarization back to electrical energy of flowing electrons. Capacitors 
are made from an insulating material between conducting plates. 
As we supply a voltage across the insulator, charges accumulate on the 
plates. The voltage built up is proportional to the charge accumulated on 
the plates. 

Q 
= 
Cv 
(2.5) 

 
2 CAPACITORS AND PIEZOELECTRIC DEVICES 25 

In Eq. 2.5, Q 
is the charge in coulombs, v 
is the voltage, and the constant of 
proportionality is the capacitance C 
in farads. If we take the derivative with 
respect to time, we get the more familiar expression relating the current 
and voltage across the capacitor.

i

C 
(2.6)

dt 


The capacitance of a capacitor is related to the permittivity of the 
dielectric material between the conductors. Permittivity is a measure of the 
amount of energy that can be stored by a dielectric material. As described 
by Eq. 1.22, for a parallel plate capacitor this relationship is 

A 


C 
= 
(2.7)
dthick 


where A 
is the area of the plates and dthick 
is the distance between the 
plates. The energy E 
stored in a capacitor as a function of voltage applied 
across it is given by 

E 
=
1 
Cv2 
=
1 
Qv. 
(2.8)

22 


The capacitance of a vacuum-filled parallel plate capacitor is described by 
Eq. 2.7 with permittivity 
= 
0, the permittivity of free space. As we 
charge the capacitor, charges accumulate on the plates, and no change 
occurs to the vacuum between the plates. If we replace the vacuum with 
a dielectric with >0, 
the capacitance becomes larger. The dielectric 
filled capacitor can store more energy, all else equal, because the dielectric 
material changes as the capacitor charges. More specifically, the material 
polarizes. In an insulator, electrons are bound to their atoms, and current 
cannot flow. Instead, the electrons in a dielectric move slightly with respect 
to their nuclei while still staying bound to the atoms. Electrons are always 
in motion for materials at temperatures above absolute zero, but when a 
material polarizes, the net location of electrons with respect to the nuclei 
changes. As the capacitor charges, the electrons are slightly displaced from 
their atoms, balancing the charges on the plates, and more energy is stored 
in the dielectric for a given voltage. We say that this process induces 
electric dipoles. The larger the permittivity, , 
the more the material can 
store energy by polarizing in this way. For this reason, capacitors are 
often filled with dielectric materials like tantalum dioxide Ta2O5 
which has 
= 
250 
[18]. A material with 
= 
250, for example, will be able to store 
25 times the energy of an air filled capacitor of the same size with the same 
applied voltage. 

 
26 2.2 Capacitors 

2.2.3 Permittivity and Related Measures 
For historical reasons, the permittivity may be expressed by different measures. 
The electric susceptibility e, 
relative permittivity r, index of refraction 
n, and permittivity 
all describe the ability of a material to store 
energy in the electric field. Electric susceptibility is a unitless measure 
related to the permittivity by 

 


e 
= 
 
1 
(2.9)

0 


and relative permittivity is another unitless measure defined by 

 


r 
= 
. 
(2.10)

0 


With some algebra, we can write the material polarization in terms of the 
relative permittivity or the electric susceptibility.

Scientists studying optics often use index of refraction, another unitless 
measure which represents the ratio of the speed of light in free space to the 
speed of light in the material. 

c 
speed of light in free space 

n == 
(2.12)

!

v 
| 
speed of light in material 

Since electromagnetic waves cannot travel faster than the speed of light 
in free space, index of refraction of a material is greater than one, n > 
1. 
Assuming a material is a good insulator and µ 
= 
0, which are typically 
safe assumption for optics, the relationship between index of refraction and 
permittivity simplifies to 

√ 


n = 
r. 
(2.13) 

Table 2.1 lists relative permittivities of some insulators used to make 
capacitors or piezoelectric devices. The values are all approximates. See 
the references cited for more detailed information. 

In the definitions of Section 1.6.3 and in Table 2.1, permittivity is 
treated as a scalar constant, but in some contexts a more complicated 
description is needed. In a crystalline material, a voltage applied along one 
crystallographic axis may induce charge separation throughout the material 
more easily than a voltage of the same size applied along a different axis.

The left part of Fig. 2.1 shows some atoms of a crystal. The small black 
circles represent the location of the nuclei of atoms in the crystals, and 
the gray circles represent the electron cloud surrounding the nuclei of each 
atom. If an electric field is applied in the a^z 
direction, the material polarizes, 
so the electrons are slightly displaced with respect to the nuclei as 
shown in the figure on the right. Since the spacing of atoms is different in 
the a^x 
and a^y 
direction than the a^z 
direction, the external field required to 
get the same charge displacement will be different in the a^x 
and a^y 
directions 
than the a^z 
direction for this material. For this reason, the material 
illustrated in the figure is anisotropic, and the permittivity is best described 
by a matrix as opposed to a scalar quantity. 

2.2.4 Capacitor Properties 
Capacitors are energy conversion devices used in applications from stabilizing 
power supplies, to filtering communication signals, to separating out a 
DC offset from an AC signal. Though capacitors and batteries both store 
electrical energy, energy in batteries is stored in the chemical bonds of 
atoms of the electrodes while energy is stored in capacitors in the material 
polarization from bound charges shifting in a dielectric layer. 

The first two measures to consider when selecting a capacitor to use in 
a circuit are the capacitance and the maximum voltage. A capacitor can

capacitor types, following [21] and [22]. 

be damaged if it is placed in a circuit where the voltage across it exceeds 
the maximum rated value. Approximate ranges for these parameters for 
capacitors with different dielectric materials are shown in Fig. 2.2. Capacitance 
ranges are on the vertical axis, and maximum voltage ranges are on 
the horizontal axis. For example, electrolytic capacitors often can be found 
with capacitance values ranging from 107 
to 1 F and maximum voltage 
ratings in the range of 1 to 1000 V. Similarly, ceramic capacitors can often 
be found with capacitance values ranging from 1013 
to 5 
· 
104 
F and 
maximum voltage ratings in the range of 1 to 50,000 V. 

While capacitance and maximum voltage rating are important parameters 
to consider, they are not the only considerations. Another factor to 
consider is temperature stability. Ideally, the capacitance will be independent 
of temperature. However, all materials have a nonzero temperature 
coefficient. Ceramic and electrolytic capacitors tend to be more sensitive to 
temperature variation than polymer or vacuum capacitors [22]. Accuracy, 
or precision, is also important. Just as resistors are labeled with tolerances, 
capacitors may have tolerances of, for example, 5% 
or 10%. Another 
factor to consider is equivalent series resistance [23, ch. 1]. All materials 
have some resistivity, so all capacitors have some finite resistance. To 
account for the internal resistance, we can model any physical capacitor 

 
30 2.2 Capacitors

as an ideal capacitor in series with an ideal resistor, and the value of the 
resistor used is called the equivalent series resistance. Also, leakage of a 
capacitor should be considered [22]. If a capacitor is able to retain its 
stored charge for a long period of time, the capacitor has small leakage. 
If the capacitor discharges quickly even when disconnected from a circuit, 
it has large leakage. An ideal capacitor has no leakage [22]. Capacitors 
are also differentiated by their lifetime. An ideal capacitor operates for 
decades without degradation. However, some types of capacitors, such as 
electrolytic capacitors, are not designed to have long lifetimes [22]. Other 
factors to consider include cost, availability, size, and frequency response 
[22]. 

Ceramics, glasses, polymers, and other materials are used as the dielectric 
[22]. Often capacitors are classified by the dielectric material they 
contain [22]. Ceramic capacitors are small, cheap, and readily available 
[22]. They can often tolerate large applied voltages [22]. They typically 
have small capacitance values, poor accuracy, poor temperature stability 
and moderate leakage [22]. They have low equivalent series resistance and 
can withstand a lot of current, but they can cause transient voltage spikes, 
[23, ch. 1]. Some ceramic capacitors are piezoelectric. If these capacitors 
are vibrated, or even tapped with a pencil, noise will be introduced in the 
circuit due to piezoelectricity [23, ch. 12]. 

Mica is an interesting material which is used as a dielectric in capacitors. 
Figure 2.3 shows naturally occurring mica collected at Ruggles Mine near 
Grafton, New Hampshire. Mica comes in different natural forms including 
biotite and muscovite KAl2(AlSi3O10)(OH)2 
[24]. Mica is a flaky mineral 
with a layered structure [24], so mica capacitors can be made with very 
thin dielectric layers. Mica capacitors often have good accuracy and small 
leakage [22]. 

Capacitor dielectrics have been made from many types of polymers in

cluding polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyester, polypropylene, Teflon, and 
mylar [22]. These capacitors often have good accuracy, temperature stability, 
and leakage characteristics [22]. 

Not all capacitors have solid dielectrics. A vacuum is a dielectric. Capacitors 
with a vacuum dielectric are used in applications which involve 
high voltage or which require very low leakage [22]. Capacitors with liquid 
dielectrics made of oil are used in similar situations [22]. Electrolytic 
capacitors often have dielectrics which are a combination of solid materials 
with liquid electrolytes. An electrolyte is a liquid through which some 
charges can flow more easily than others. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized, 
meaning that they have positive and negative terminals, so, similar to 
a diode, the orientation of the capacitor in a circuit is important. Inside an 
electrolytic capacitor is a junction of multiple materials. The initial application 
of voltage in the factory chemically creates an oxide layer which is 
the dielectric. Reversing the voltage will dissolve the dielectric and destroy 
the capacitor. One advantage of electrolytic capacitors is that a small device 
can have a large capacitance. However, they often have poor accuracy, 
temperature stability, and leakage [22]. Also, electrolytic capacitors have a 
finite lifetime because the liquid can degrade over time. 

2.3 Piezoelectric Devices 
Can we induce a material polarization in an insulator in a way that does 
not involve applying a voltage? If so, then this method can charge a capacitor, 
and we can discharge the capacitor as usual to produce electricity. 
Any device that accomplishes this task is an energy conversion device. 

 
32 2.3 Piezoelectric Devices 
Piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and electro-optic devices all involve this type 
of energy conversion, and they are all currently available as sensors and 
as other products. In piezoelectric devices, discussed in this section, a 
mechanical stress causes a material polarization. 

If a large enough strain is exerted on a material, the crystal structure 
will change. For example, at high enough temperature and pressure, coal 
will crystallize into diamond, and when the pressure is removed, the material 
stays in diamond form. Steel can be hardened by repeatedly hitting it 
in a process called shot peening. A significant amount of energy is needed 
to permanently change the crystal structure of a material. In this section, 
we are not discussing this effect. Instead, we are discussing an effect that 
typically requires little energy. When a mechanical strain is exerted on 
a piezoelectric device, a material polarization is established. The valence 
electrons are displaced, but the nuclei of the material and other electrons 
do not move. When we release the stress, the material polarization goes 
away. 

2.3.1 Piezoelectric Strain Constant 
We can describe the material polarization of a piezoelectric insulating material 
by incorporating a term which depends on the applied mechanical 
stress, [25].

while stress has units pascals. Without an external electric field, these 
quantities are related by Young's elastic modulus which has units mN

or are made from materials with larger piezoelectric constants store more 
energy. 

According to Eq. 2.14, the material polarization of an insulating crystal 
is linearly proportional to the applied stress. While this accurately 
describes many materials, it is a poor description of other materials. For 
other piezoelectric crystals, the material polarization is proportional to the 
square of the applied stress

2.3.2 Piezoelectricity in Crystalline Materials 
To understand which materials are piezoelectric, we need to introduce some 
terminology for describing crystals. Crystalline materials may be composed 
of elements, such as Si, or compounds, such as NaCl. By definition, atoms 
in crystals are arranged periodically. Two components are specified to 
describe the arrangement of atoms in a crystal: a lattice and a basis [25, 

p.4]. A lattice is a periodic array of points in space. An n-dimensional 
lattice is specified by n 
lattice vectors for integer n. We can get from one 
lattice point to every other lattice point by traveling an integer number of 
 
!

!!

lattice vectors. Three vectors, a1 
;a2, 
and  
a3 
, are used to describe physical 
lattices in three-space. The choice of lattice vectors is not unique. Lattice 
vectors which are as short as possible are called primitive lattice vectors.A 
cell of a lattice is the area (2D) or volume (3D) formed by lattice vectors. 
A primitive cell is the area or volume formed by primitive lattice vectors, 
and it is the smallest possible repeating unit which describes a lattice.

BasisLatticeCrystal structure!a1!a2
Figure 2.5: Two dimensional illustration of the terms lattice, basis, crystal 
structure, and primitive lattice vector. 

To specify the structure of a material, we attach one or more atoms to 
every point in the lattice. This arrangement of atoms is called a crystal 
basis. The lattice and crystal basis together define the crystal structure 
[25]. Figure 2.5 shows a two dimensional example of a lattice, crystal 
basis, and crystal structure. Since this example is two dimensional, only 
two lattice vectors are needed to specify the lattice. Two primitive lattice 
vectors are shown, and a primitive cell is shaded. 

There are 14 possible three dimensional lattice types, and these are 
called Bravais lattices [25]. Each of these possible lattices has a descriptive 
name. Figure 2.6 shows four of the possible Bravais lattices: simple cubic, 
body centered cubic, face centered cubic, and asymmetric triclinic. In the 
simple cubic lattice, all angles between line segments connecting nearest 
neighbor points are right angles, and all lengths between nearest neighbor 
points are equal. In the asymmetric triclinic lattice, none of these angles 
are right angles, and none of these lengths between nearest neighbor points 
are equal. Figure 2.6 shows lattice cells, but the cells for the body centered 
cubic and face centered cubic lattices are not primitive cells because smaller 
repeating units can be found. 

Consider some example lattices and crystal structures. The crystal 
structure of sodium chloride, for example, involves a face centered cubic 
lattice and a basis composed of one sodium and one chlorine atom. Another 
example is silicon which crystallizes in what is known as the diamond 
structure [25]. This crystal structure involves a face centered cubic lattice

 

lll

and a basis composed of two silicon atoms, at location (0, 
0, 
0) 
and ;;

where l 
is the length of the primitive cell. Carbon, Si, Ge, and Sn all crystallize 
in this diamond structure with cell lengths of l 
=0:356, 
0.543, 0.565, 
and 0.646 nm respectively [25]. 

While there are only 14 possible three dimensional lattices, there are 
significantly more possible crystal structures because the crystal structure 
also incorporates the basis. It is not possible to list all possible crystal 
structures. Instead, they are classified based on the symmetries they contain. 
Possible symmetry operations are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold 
rotations, horizontal and vertical mirror planes, and inversion. Crystal 
structures are grouped based on the symmetry elements they contain into 
classes called crystal point groups. There are 32 possible crystal point 
groups, and they are listed in the Table 2.2. 

Some authors classify crystal structures into crystal space groups instead 
of crystal point groups [6] [26]. While there are 32 crystal point groups, 
there are 230 crystal space groups. Crystal space groups are based on 
symmetry transformations which can incorporate not only rotations and 
mirror planes but also combination of translations along with rotations 
and mirror planes. Crystal space groups will not be discussed further in 
this text.

Figure 2.7: Shapes used to illustrate symmetry elements. 

As an example of identifying symmetry elements, consider the 2D shapes 
in Fig. 2.7. The T-shaped figure has one symmetry element, a mirror plane 
symmetry. The shape looks the same if it is reflected over the mirror plane 
shown in the figure by a dotted line. The Q-shape has no symmetry elements. 
The hexagon has multiple symmetry elements. It contains 2-fold 
rotation because it looks the same when rotated by 180◦ 
. It also has 3-fold 
and 6-fold rotation symmetries because it looks the same when rotated by 
60◦ 
and 30◦ 
respectively. It also has multiple mirror planes shown by dotted 
lines in the figure. In this example, symmetry elements of 2D shapes 
are identified, but material scientists are interested in identifying symmetries 
of 3D crystal structures to gain insights in the properties of materials. 
Materials are classified into categories called crystal point groups based on 
the symmetries of their crystal structures. 

We generalize about crystalline materials based on whether or not their 
crystal structure possesses inversion symmetry. What is the inversion operation? 
In 2D, inversion is the same as a rotation by 180◦ 
. In 3D, a 
shape or crystal structure contains inversion symmetry if it is identical 
when rotated by 180◦ 
and inverted through the origin [24, p. 269]. More 



 


specifically, draw a vector 

V

from the center of the shape to any point 

on the surface. If the shape has inversion symmetry, then for any such 

 


 


vector 

V

, the point a distance 

V

from the origin is also on the surface 

of the shape. The example on the left of Fig. 2.8 has inversion symmetry



 


because for any such vector 

V

from the center of the shape to a point on 



 


the surface, there is a point on the surface a vector

If a crystal structure has inversion symmetry, we say the crystal has 
a center of symmetry otherwise we say it is noncentrosymmetric. Crystal 
structures are classified into classes called crystal point groups, and twenty

shape on the right does not. 

one of the 32 point groups have no center of symmetry thus do not contain 
inversion symmetry [24, p. 35]. Twenty of these crystal point groups have 
a polar axis, some axis in the crystal with different forms on opposite ends 
of the axis. These twenty one crystal point groups are specified as noncentrosymmetric 
in the sixth column of Table 2.2. If we mechanically stress 
these materials along the polar axis, different amounts of charges will build 
up on the different sides of the axis. Dielectric crystalline materials whose 
crystal structure belongs to any one of these 21 of these noncentrosymmetric 
crystal point groups are piezoelectric [24]. 

Table 2.2 lists all crystal point groups and summarizes whether crystalline 
materials whose crystal structure belongs to each group can be 
piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and Pockels electro-optic. Pyroelectricity and 
electro-optics are discussed in the next chapter. Information in the table 
comes from references [24] [26] [27] [28]. The left two column list the 32 
possible crystal point groups. There are two different, but equivalent, ways 
of labeling the crystal point groups. The first column names the crystal 
point groups using Hermann-Mauguin notation. This notation dates to the 
1930s and is used by chemists, mineralogists, and some physicists. The 
second column names the crystal point groups using Schoenflies notation. 
Schoenflies notation dates from 1891 [29], and it is used by mathematicians, 
spectroscopists, and other physicists. 

The third column of Table 2.2 lists the crystal system. As shown in Fig.

2.9, the angles of a primitive cell of a lattice are labeled , 
 , 
and , and 
the lengths of the sides are labeled a, 
b, 
and c. Crystal point groups can 
be classified based on the angles and lengths of the primitive cell of the 
lattice which belongs to that group. The literature contains multiple subtly 
different ways of defining crystal systems [30]. The information in the 
third column follows reference [28]. The fourth column gives relationships 
between the angles of the primitive cell. The fifth column gives relationships 
between the lengths of sides of the primitive cell. Combinations of 
angles and lengths are not unique to a specific row. For example, classes 
C2 
and C1h 
both have α

, β

, and a

c. However, 
crystal structures belonging to these crystal point groups contain different 
symmetry elements. For more details on specifically which symmetry elements 
are contained in which crystal point group, see [24] [26] [27] [28]. 
The sixth column lists whether or not the crystal point group has inversion 
symmetry. Crystal structures with no inversion symmetry or center of 
symmetry, called noncentrosymmetric, are both piezoelectric and Pockels 
electro-optic. The last column lists whether or not crystalline materials 
whose crystal structure belongs to the various crystal point groups can be 
pyroelectric. 

It is possible to start with a crystal structure of a material, derive 
the symmetry elements it contains, derive whether or not the material is 
piezoelectric, and derive whether or not the material is pyroelectric. Furthermore, 
it is possible to derive along which axes piezoelectricity or pyroelectricity 
can occur in the material. However, this derivation is beyond 
the scope of this book. For further details, see [6] [27] [28] [31]. 

To predict whether or not a dielectric crystalline material is piezoelectric, 
identify its lattice and crystal basis to identify its crystal structure. 
Identify the symmetries of the crystal structure to classify its crystal structure 
into a particular crystal point group. If that crystal structure contains 
inversion symmetry, the material can be piezoelectric. We often do not 

 
2 CAPACITORS AND PIEZOELECTRIC DEVICES 41 

have to go through all of these steps because the crystal point group for 
many crystalline materials is tabulated [32]. Even if the crystal structure 
for a material contains inversion symmetry, the piezoelectric effect and the 
piezoelectric strain coefficient d 
may be too small to measure. 

The effect may only occur when you stress the material along some 
particular axis, and it may not occur for a mechanical stress of an arbitrary 
orientation with respect to the direction of the crystal axes. There is 
only one crystal point group, called asymmetric triclinic, where a random 
stress will produce a material polarization [24]. For all other point groups, 
only stresses along certain axes will produce a material polarization [24]. 
Furthermore, in most crystals a given amount of stress along one axis of 
the crystal will produce a different amount of material polarization than 
the same amount of stress applied along a different crystallographic axis. 
Qualitatively, compressing a crystal along one axis may cause more charge 
displacement than compressing a crystal along a different axis. For this 
reason, it is more accurate to treat the piezoelectric strain coefficient as a 
matrix. This 3x6 matrix has elements

2.3.3 Piezoelectricity in Amorphous and Polycrystalline Materials and Ferroelectricity 
The previous section discussed piezoelectricity in crystals. We can discuss 
symmetries of the crystal structure of crystalline materials, but we cannot 
even define a crystal structure for amorphous materials. However, it is 
possible to make piezoelectric devices out of polycrystalline and amorphous 
materials. In a dielectrics, if we apply an external electric field, a material 
polarization is induced. Electric dipoles form because the electrons and 
nuclei of the atoms displace slightly from each other. Coulomb's law tells 
us that charge buildups, such as these electric dipoles, induce an electric 
field. So, if we apply an external electric field to a dielectric, this primary 
effect induces a material polarization, and this material polarization will, 
as a secondary effect, induce additional material polarization in the material. 
Once one atom polarizes forming an electric dipole, nearby atoms 
will polarize. Small regions of the same material polarization are called 
electrical domains. 

 
42 2.3 Piezoelectric Devices 
In certain dielectric materials, an external mechanical stress induces a 
local material polarization. The charge buildup of this material polarization 
induces a material polarization in nearby atoms forming electrical domains 
[23]. This piezoelectric effect can occur whether the original material is 
crystalline, amorphous, or polycrystalline [23]. In noncrystalline materials, 
this effect is necessarily nonlinear, so these materials are not well described 
by Eqs. 2.14 or 2.19. 

The nonlinear process of a material polarization of one atom inducing 
a material polarization of nearby atoms causing the formation of electrical 
domains is called ferroelectricity. Ferroelectric materials may be crystalline, 
amorphous, or polycrystalline. We will see in the next chapter that 
materials can be ferroelectric pyroelectric and ferroelectric electro-optic in 
addition to ferroelectric piezoelectric. The ferroelectric effect is limited by 
temperature. For many ferroelectric materials, these effects occur only below 
some temperature, called the Curie temperature. When the materials 
are heated above the Curie temperature, the ferroelectric effect goes away 
[33]. The material polarization of a ferroelectric material may depend on 
whether or not a material polarization has previously been induced. If the 
state of a material depends on its past history, we say that the material has 

hysteresis. Ferroelectric materials may have a material polarization even 
in the absence of an external mechanical stress or electric field if a source 
of energy has previously been applied. 

While the prefix ferro-means iron, most ferroelectric materials do not 
contain iron, and most iron containing materials are not ferroelectric. The 
word ferroelectric is used as an analogy to the word ferromagnetic. Some 
iron containing materials are ferromagnetic. If an external magnetic field is 
applied across a ferromagnetic material, an internal magnetic field is set up 
in the material. Ferromagnetic materials can have a permanent magnetic 
dipole even in the absence of an applied magnetic field. We can model an 
electric dipole as a pair of charges. We can model a magnetic dipole as a 
small current loop. Ferromagnetic materials exhibit hysteresis, and they 
have magnetic domains where the magnetic dipoles are aligned. 

Originally, a piezoelectric ferroelectric material has randomly aligned 
electrical domains and no net material polarization, so it starts out as 
neither piezoelectric or ferroelectric. The process of causing a material 
to exhibit piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity is called poling. To pole 
a material, place it in a strong external electric field [23], for example, 
across the poles of a battery, hence the term. Poling does not change 
the atomic structure, so if the material was originally amorphous, it will 
remain amorphous. During this process, electrical domains form, and these 
domains remain even when the external field is removed. A material that is 

 
2 CAPACITORS AND PIEZOELECTRIC DEVICES 43 

piezoelectric due to this type of poling is sometimes called an electret [15, 

p. 297]. After the material is poled, it may have a net material polarization 
throughout. Furthermore after poling, it is piezoelectric and ferroelectric, 
so an external mechanical stress induces a material polarization locally and 
throughout the material. 
2.3.4 Materials Used to Make Piezoelectric Devices 
What makes a good material for a piezoelectric sensor or piezoelectric energy 
conversion device? First piezoelectric devices are made from electrical 
insulators. When an external voltage is applied across a conductor, valence 
electrons are removed from their atoms, so no material polarization 
accumulates. Second, piezoelectric devices are made from materials with 
large piezoelectric strain constants. The piezoelectric strain constant is so 
small that it cannot be detected in many crystals with crystal structures 
from one of the 21 crystal point groups known to be piezoelectric, and it 
is zero in crystals from the other crystal point groups. Third, piezoelectric 
devices should be made from materials that are not brittle so that they can 
withstand repeated stressing without permanent damage. Thermal properties 
may also be important [33]. There is no material that is best in all 
applications. 

Quartz, crystalline SiO2, was the first material in which piezoelectricity 
was studied. Pierre and Jacques Curie discovered the effect in quartz in the 
1880s [3]. Today, many piezoelectric devices, including crystal oscillators, 
are made from quartz. Lead zirconium titanate is another material used due 
to its relatively high piezoelectric strain constant [3] [34]. In applications 
which require flexibility and the ability to withstand repeated mechanical 
stress without damage, polymers such as polyvinyldenfluoride are used [25]. 
Piezoelectricity has also been studied in materials including barium titanate 
BaTiO3, lithium niobate, tourmaline

and Rochelle salt

[3] [23] [24] [34]. 

Manufacturers of piezoelectric devices do not often label their products 
to say whether they are made from crystalline, amorphous, or polycrystalline 
materials, but there are advantages and disadvantages to the different 
types of materials. An advantage of making piezoelectric devices 
from polycrystalline or amorphous materials is that the devices can be 

 
44 2.3 Piezoelectric Devices 
made more easily into different shapes such as cylinders and spheres [33]. 
However, the materials used often have lower melting temperatures, higher 
temperature expansion coefficients, and are more brittle [33]. Crystalline 
materials, such as quartz, have the advantages of being harder and having 
a higher melting temperature [33]. 

2.3.5 Applications of Piezoelectricity 
A number of electrical components involve piezoelectricity. When a voltage 
is applied across a piece of piezoelectric material, it mechanically bends and 
deforms. When the voltage is released, it springs back at a natural resonant 
frequency. This material can be integrated with a feedback circuit 
to produce oscillations at a precise frequency. Electrical oscillators of this 
type are often made from crystalline quartz. A more recent application 
is the piezoelectric transformer. These devices are used in the cold cathode 
fluorescent lamps which are used as backlight for LCD panels [23, p. 
289]. The lamps require around a thousand volts to turn on and hundreds 
of volts during use. Transformers made of magnets and coils can achieve 
these high voltages, but piezoelectric transformers are much smaller, small 
enough to be mounted on a printed circuit board. A traditional transformer 
involves a pair of coils, and it converts AC electricity to magnetic 
energy to AC electricity at a different voltage. Similarly, a piezoelectric 
transformer also involves multiple energy conversion processes. In such a 
device, AC electricity is converted to mechanical vibrations and then to 
AC electricity at a different voltage. Energy is conserved in these devices, 
so they can produce high voltages with low currents. Figure 2.10 shows 
a piezoelectric transformer that can convert an input of 8 to 14 V to an 
output up to 2 kV [35]. Figure 2.11 shows an example of some small piezoelectric 
circuit components. Starting in the upper left and going clockwise, 
a microphone, ultrasonic transmitter and receiver, vibration sensor, and 
oscillator are shown. 

Efficiency of energy conversion devices is hard to discuss because every 
author makes different assumptions. However by any measure, efficiency of 
a commercial piezoelectric device is low, often 6% or less [36]. Due to this 
low efficiency, many piezoelectric devices are used as sensors. Regardless 
of this low efficiency, other devices are used for energy harvesting. For 
example, one train station embedded piezoelectric devices in the platforms 
to generate electricity. Piezoelectric devices also have been used to convert 
the energy from the motion of a fluid or from wind directly to electricity 
[36]. 

There is interest in using piezoelectric devices for biomedical applica

tions. Quartz is piezoelectric, and it is durable, readily available, and 
nontoxic. Engineers have developed piezoelectric devices designed for use 
outside of the body and to be implanted inside the body. Some piezoelectric 
devices are used as sensors. For example, piezoelectric sensors can monitor 
knees or other joints [3]. Also, ultrasonic imaging is a common diagnostic 
technique. Piezoelectric devices are used both to generate the ultrasonic 
vibrations and to detect them [33]. Other biomedical piezoelectric devices 
are used as a source of electrical power. Artificial hearts, pacemakers, and 
other devices require electricity, and they are often limited by battery technology 
available to supply the energy [36]. Piezoelectric generators have 
no moving parts to wear out, and they can avoid the problem of needing 
to change the batteries. Physical activity can be classified as continuous, 
such as breathing, or discontinuous, such as walking. Both types of physical 
activity can be used as a source of mechanical energy for piezoelectric 
devices [36]. The amount of power required for different biomedical devices 
varies quite a bit. For example, an artificial heart may require around 8 W 
while a pacemaker may require only a few microwatts [36]. Piezoelectric 
devices may be able to capture energy from typical physical activity and 
convert it into electrical energy to power the device. A piezoelectric device 
in an artificial knee has produced 0.85 mW [36], and a device in a shoe has 
generated 8.4 mW from walking [36]. 

Piezoelectric devices are used in other types of imaging systems besides 
biomedical imaging systems. One of the earlier applications was in sonar 
systems. Around the time of WWI, the military actively developed sonar 
systems to detect boats and submarines. Today, sonar systems are used to 
detect fish and to measure the depth of bodies of water [33]. Sonar imaging 
is also used to analyze electrical circuits and to detect imperfections and 
cracks in steel and in welds [33]. 

Piezoelectric devices are used in a variety of other applications too. 
Piezoelectric sensors are used in some buttons and keyboards [36]. Piezoelectric 
devices are used to make accelerometers [37, p. 353], and they are 
used to measure pipe flow [33]. Speakers, microphones and buzzers can all 
be made from piezoelectric devices, and they can operate at both audio 
and ultrasonic frequencies. Piezoelectric devices that generate ultrasonic 
signals can be used to emulsify dyes, paints, and food products like peanut 
butter [33]. Also, they are used in some barbecue grill ignitions where 
mechanical stress induces an electric spark [23, ch. 15].

3.1 Introduction 
Electrical engineers interested in materials often focus their study on semiconductors 
or occasionally conductors. However, energy conversion devices 
are made out of all types of materials. In the last chapter we discussed capacitors 
and piezoelectric devices. Both are constructed from a layer of 
insulating material between conductors. The properties of this dielectric 
layer determine the properties of the resulting devices. This chapter discusses 
two additional types of devices that involve material polarization 
of insulators, pyroelectric devices and electro-optic devices. As with other 
types of energy conversion devices, these can operate two ways. Pyroelectric 
devices can convert a temperature difference to a material polarization 
and therefore electricity, or they can convert a material polarization to a 
temperature difference. Electro-optic devices can convert optical electromagnetic 
radiation to a material polarization or vice versa. As with the 
devices studied in the last chapter, these devices are constructed around 
a dielectric layer, and the choice of material in the dielectric layer determines 
the behavior of the device. Studying these devices is worthwhile 
even though they are encountered significantly less often than capacitors 
and piezoelectric devices because this study illustrates the variety of energy 
conversion devices that engineers have produced. 

If a solid is heated enough, it melts. Some materials have multiple 
crystal structures that are stable at room temperature. These materials 
may be converted from one crystal structure to another by heating and 
cooling. Similar effects can occur if energy is supplied by shining a strong 
enough laser on the material instead of heating it. This chapter is not 
concerned with effects involving melting or thermally changing the crystal 
structure from one phase to another. Instead, we consider the case when a 
small amount of energy is supplied, by heat or by electromagnetic radiation. 
The energies involved are enough to change the material polarization and 
the internal momentum of electrons but not the location of the nuclei of 
the material, for example. 

3.2 Pyroelectricity 
3.2.1 Pyroelectricity in Crystalline Materials 
Pyroelectric devices are energy conversion devices which convert a temperature 
difference to or from electricity through changes in material polarization. 
The pyroelectric effect was first studied by Hayashi in 1912 and by

is defined in Sec. 3.3.1. 

Rontgen in 1914 [3] [40]. This effect occurs in insulators, so it is different 
from the thermoelectric effect. The thermoelectric effect, to be discussed in 
Chapter 8, is a process that converts between energy of a temperature difference 
and electricity and occurs because heat and charges flow at different 
rates through junctions. 

If an insulating crystal is placed in an external electric field, the material 
will polarize. The electrons will displace slightly forming electric dipoles, 
and energy can be stored in this material polarization. In some pyroelectric 
materials, heating or cooling will also cause the material to polarize. We 
can model the material polarization by adding a term to Eq. 2.14 to account 
for the temperature dependence [3, p. 327].

Many materials exhibit pyroelectricity only below a temperature known as 
the pyroelectric Curie temperature. 

In the last chapter, we saw that we could determine whether or not a 
crystalline material was piezoelectric from its crystal structure. To do so, 
we identified the symmetries of the crystal structure. Crystal structures are 
grouped into 32 classes called crystal point groups based on the symmetries 
they contain. Crystal structures in the 21 of the crystal point groups that 
do not have a center of symmetry can be piezoelectric. We can use a similar 
technique to determine if a crystalline material is or is not pyroelectric. 
All pyroelectric crystals are piezoelectric, but not all piezoelectric crystals 
are pyroelectric. To determine if a crystalline material can be pyroelectric, 
identify its crystal structure and determine the corresponding crystal 
point group. Crystals in the 10 crystal point groups listed in Table 2.2 are 
pyroelectric [3, p. 366] [26, p. 557]. 

3.2.2 Pyroelectricity in Amorphous and Polycrystalline Materials and Ferroelectricity 
In the Sec. 2.3.3 we saw that some materials, called ferroelectric piezoelectric 
materials, had a material polarization that depended nonlinearly 
on the mechanical stress applied. These materials could be crystalline, 
amorphous, or polycrystalline. When a charge separation occurred in one 
atom, the charges from that electric dipole induce dipoles to form in nearby 
atoms, and electrical domains with aligned material polarization form in 
the material. This effect depends on the mechanical stress applied to the 
material previously, and the dependence on past history is called hysteresis. 

Materials can also be ferroelectric pyroelectric, and these materials can 
be crystalline, amorphous, or polycrystalline. In these materials, the material 
polarization depends nonlinearly on the temperature, as opposed to 
the mechanical stress. As with the piezoelectric version of this effect, polarization 
of one atom induces a material polarization in nearby atoms. 
Such materials can have a material polarization even when no temperature 
gradient is applied, and they can exhibit hysteresis. 

3.2.3 Materials and Applications of Pyroelectric Devices 
Pyroelectricity has been studied in a number of materials including barium 
titanate BaTiO3, lead titanate PbTiO3, and potassium hydrogen phosphate 

 
56 3.3 Electro-Optics 

KH2PO4 
[25] [26]. It has also been studied in chalcogenide glasses which are 
sulfides, selenides, and tellurides such as GeTe [25] [26]. When selecting a 
pyroelectric material for an application, the pyroelectric coefficient should 
be considered. Thermal properties are important too. The material should 
be able to withstand repeated heating and cooling, and it should have a 
relatively high melting temperature to be useful. 

The pyroelectric effect does not have many applications. Some optical 
detectors designed to detect infrared light are made from pyroelectric materials 
[41] [42]. However, most optical detectors are photovoltaic devices 
made from semiconductor junctions, and this technology will be discussed 
in Chapter 6. While sensors using the pyroelectric effect could be used to 
measure temperature, other types of temperature sensors, such as thermocouples, 
are typically used. Thermocouples, which operate based on the 
thermoelectric effect which is discussed in Chapter 8, are more convenient 
to build and operate. Additionally, in many pyroelectric materials, the effect 
is nonlinear while linear sensors are easier to work with and calibrate. 

3.3 Electro-Optics 
3.3.1 Electro-Optic Coefficients 
Typically, the magnitude of material polarization in a dielectric is proportional 
to the strength of an applied electric field.

In this equation e 
is the electric susceptibility, and it is unitless. It is 
defined in Sec. 2.2.3 and related to permittivity by Eq. 2.9. However in 
other materials, the material polarization depends nonlinearly on the applied 
electric field. Materials for which the material polarization depends 
linearly on the external electric field are called linear materials while others 
are called nonlinear or electro-optic materials. The electro-optic effect occurs 
when an applied external electric field induces a material polarization 
in a material where the amount of polarization depends nonlinearly on the 
external field. The name involves the word optic because the external field 
is often due to a visible laser beam. However, the external field can be 
from any type of source at any frequency, and a material polarization will 
occur even with a constant applied electric field. A large enough external 
electric field will cause a material to melt or to crystallize in a different 
phase, but this effect is not the electro-optic effect. Instead, the electro-
optic effect only involves a change in the material polarization, not the 
crystal structure, and the change involved is not permanent.

We can write the magnitude of the material polarization as a function 
of powers of the applied external field.

The quantity (2) 
is called the chi-two coefficient, and it has units mV. The 

quantity (3) 
is called the chi-three coefficient, and it has units mV2
2 
[27] [42, 
ch. 1]. 

If an infinite number of terms are included on the right side of Eq. 3.4, 
any arbitrary material can be described. In most materials, only the first 

;(3)

term of Eq. 3.4 is needed while (2) 
, and all higher order coefficients 
are negligible, and these materials are not electro-optic. Materials with 

(2), (3) 


or other coefficients nonzero are called electro-optic. It is rare to 
need more coefficients than e;(2), 
and (3) 
to describe a material.

The effect due to the 0(2) 
E 
term is called the Pockels effect or 
linear electro-optic effect. It was first observed by Friedrich Pockels in 
1893 [3, p. 382] [10]. In this case the material polarization depends on 

 
3

 


the square of the external field. The effect due to the 0(3) 
E 
term is 
called the Kerr effect or the quadratic electro-optic effect. In this case, 
the material polarization depends on the cube of the external electric field. 
John Kerr first described this effect in 1875 [3, p. 382] [10]. 
While some authors use the coefficients e, (2) 
and (3), this effect is 
most often studied by optics scientists who instead prefer index of refraction 
n, a unitless measure introduced in Sec. 2.2.3. In electro-optic materials, 
the index of refraction is a nonlinear function of the strength of the external 
electric field. Instead of expanding the material polarization in a power 
series as a function of the external field strength as in Eq. 3.4, the index of 
refraction is expanded. Pockels and Kerr coefficients are defined as terms 
of this expansion. 
C

As described by Eq. 2.3, material polarization is the difference in m2 
between an external electric field in a material and the field in the absence 
of the material.

3.3.2 Electro-Optic Effect in Crystalline Materials 
As with the piezoelectric effect, we can determine which crystalline insulating 
materials will exhibit the Pockels effect by looking at the symmetries 
of the material. To determine if a crystal can show the Pockels effect, determine 
the crystal structure, identify the symmetries, and determine its 
crystal point group. The Pockels effect occurs in noncentrosymmetric materials, 
materials with a crystal structure with no inversion symmetry. Of 
the 32 crystal point groups, 21 of these groups may exhibit the Pockels 
electro-optic effect. For materials in these crystal point groups, (2) 
and 
the Pockels coefficient γ 
are nonzero. These 21 groups are also the piezoelectric 
crystal point groups [10, ch. 18], and they are listed in Table 2.2. 
In some crystalline materials which belong to these crystal point groups, 
the Pockels effect is nonzero but too small to be measurable. 

From Table 2.2 we can see that all materials that are piezoelectric are 
also Pockels electro-optic and vice versa. Also, all materials that are pyroelectric 
are piezoelectric but not the other way around. Thus, if a device is 

 
60 3.3 Electro-Optics 

used as an electro-optic device, and the device is accidentally mechanically 
stressed or vibrated, the material polarization will be induced by piezoelectricity. 
In many devices, these effects simultaneously occur, and it can 
be difficult to identify the primary cause of a material polarization when 
multiple effects simultaneously occur. 

Tables of Pockels electro-optic coefficients for crystals can be found in 
reference [27] and [42]. 

The Kerr electro-optic effect can occur in crystals whether or not they 
belong to a crystal point group which has a center of symmetry, so some 
materials exhibit the Kerr effect but not the Pockels effect. In many materials, 
the Kerr effect is quite small. 

3.3.3 Electro-Optic Effect in Amorphous and Polycrystalline Materials 
Table 2.2 only applies to crystalline materials because only crystalline materials 
have a specific crystal structure and can be classified into to a crystal 
point group. However, crystalline, polycrystalline, and amorphous materials 
can all be electro-optic. In amorphous and polycrystalline materials, 
the electro-optic effect is necessarily nonlinear. When an external electric 
field, for example from a laser, is applied, a material polarization develops. 
The charge separation in that region induces a material polarization 
in nearby atoms. Just as materials can be ferroelectric piezoelectric and 
ferroelectric pyroelectric, amorphous and polycrystalline materials can be 
ferroelectric electro-optic. 

3.3.4 Applications of Electro-Optics 
Some controllable optical devices are made from electro-optic materials. 
Examples of such devices include controllable lenses, prisms, phase modulators, 
switches, and couplers [10]. Operation of these devices typically 
involves two laser beams. One of these beams controls the material polarization 
of the device. The intensity, phase, or electromagnetic polarization 
of the second optical beam is altered as it travels through the device [10, 

p. 698-700]. Combinations of these electro-optic devices are used to make 
controllable optical logic gates and interconnects for optical computing applications 
[10, ch. 21] [31, ch. 20]. 
Most memory devices are not made from electro-optic materials, but 
some creative memory device designs involve electro-optic materials. For 
example, electro-optic materials are used for some rewritable memory [10, 

p. 712] [27, p. 534] and for hologram storage [10, ch. 21] [27, ch. 20]. 
 
3 PYROELECTRICS AND ELECTRO-OPTICS 61 

Also, electro-optic materials are used in liquid crystal displays [10, ch. 18]. 
Liquid crystals are electro-optic materials because an external voltage alters 
their material polarization [10, ch. 18]. 

Electro-optic materials are also used to convert an optical beam at one 
frequency to an optical beam at a different frequency. Second harmonic 
generation involves converting an optical beam with photons of energy E 
to a beam with photons at energy 21 
E 
[10, ch. 19] [27, ch. 18] [31, ch. 16]. 
Electro-optic materials are used in the second harmonic generation process 
as well as in the related processes of third harmonic generation, three wave 
mixing, four wave mixing, optical parametric oscillation, and stimulated 
Raman scattering [10, ch. 19]. 

3.4 Notation Quagmire 
This text attempts to use notation consistent with the literature. However, 
consistency is a challenge because every author seems to have a different 
name for the same physical phenomena. Furthermore, the same term used 
by different authors may have completely different meanings. For example, 
as described by Eq. 2.19, in some materials, a mechanical stress induces a 
material polarization proportional to the square of that stress. This text 
calls this phenomenon piezoelectricity, or to be more specific, quadratic 
piezoelectricity. However, references [3] and [6] call this phenomenon electrostriction. 
To make matters worse, reference [33] calls this effect ferro-
electricity. Some authors make different assumptions when using terms too. 
For example, when reference [26] uses the term ferroelectricity, it assumes 
crystalline materials, but it makes no assumptions about whether the effect 
is linear or not. 

Table 3.2 summarizes the notation used in this text to describe energy 
conversion processes involving material polarization. The first column lists 
the name used here to describe the effect. The second column lists what 
effect causes a material polarization. The third column describes whether 
the effect occurs in crystals only. The fourth column describes whether the 
material polarization varies linearly or not with the parameter described 
in the second column. The next column lists references which call this 
effect ferroelectricity. The last column gives names used by other references 
to describe this particular phenomenon. The last two columns are quite 
incomplete because a thorough literature survey was not done. However, 
these columns show quite a variety to the terminology even for the small 
fraction of the literature reviewed. 

You might think that you can avoid confusion of terminology by looking 
for Greek or Latin roots. While many of the terms introduced in the preced

ing chapters do have etymological roots, looking at the roots of the words 
does not help and sometimes makes matters worse. As discussed above, 
the prefix ferro-means iron. However, the ferroelectric effect has nothing 
to do with iron, and ferroelectric materials rarely contain iron. This name 
is an analogy to ferromagnetics. Some forms of iron are ferromagnetic. In 
ferromagnetics, an external magnetic field changes the permeability of a 
material. In ferroelectrics, an external electric field influences the permittivity. 
To make matters worse, iron has the periodic table symbol Fe while 
iridium has the symbol Ir. In this text, the term pyroelectric effect follows 
Roentengen's terminology which dates 1914 [3]. The root pyro-, showing 
up in pyroelectricity, also shows up in pyrite and pyrrhotite which are iron 
containing compounds. 

Sometimes the terms phase change and photodarkening are applied to 
the electro-optic effect in amorphous materials, but not crystalline materials. 
More specifically, sulfides, selenides, and tellurides, referred to as 
chalcogenides, are sometimes called phase change materials. Examples include 
GeAsS, GeInSe, and so on. The word chalcogenide is itself a misnomer. 
The prefix chalc-comes from the Greek root meaning copper [24]. 
They are named in analogy to CuS, chalcosulfide. The name phase change 
material was popularized by a company that made CDs and battery components. 
While crystalline materials can also be electro-optic, the name 
phase change is not typically applied to crystals. 

Sometimes the terminology used in the literature can be quite different 
from the terminology of this text. For example, reference [44] describes 
material polarization in chalcogenide glasses by saying that when exposed 
to external optical electric fields, a material stores energy by "a transient 
exciton which can be visualized as a transient intimate valence alternation 
defect pair. ... "This means essentially that macroscopic anisotropies 
result from geminate recombination of electron-hole pairs, which do not 
diffuse out of the microscopic entity in which they were created by absorbed 
photons. An exciton is a bound electron-hole pair. In other words, 
the material polarizes. When an external optical electric field is applied, 
electric dipoles form throughout the material. When reading the literature 
related to piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, and electro-optics, be aware that 
there is not much consistency in the terminology used.

4.1 Introduction 
In the previous two chapters we discussed energy conversion devices which 
are made from insulators and which are related to capacitors. In Chapters 
4 and 5 we discuss energy conversion devices involving conductors and 
related to inductors. Maxwell's equations say that time varying electric 
fields induce magnetic fields and time varying magnetic fields induce electric 
fields. If a permanent magnet moves near a coil of wire, the time varying 
magnetic field will induce a current in the coil of wire. This idea is the 
basis behind motors and electrical generators, which are some of the most 
common energy conversion devices. However, they are outside the scope 
of this text because they involve magnets and coils. Instead, we will study 
two other types of energy conversion devices based on this same principle. 
In this chapter we discuss antennas, and in the next chapter we will discuss 
Hall effect devices. 

Antennas are energy conversion devices that convert between electrical 
energy and electromagnetic energy. Antennas can act as both transmitters 
and receivers. Transmitters convert electrical energy of the flow of electrons 
to energy of electromagnetic waves. Receivers convert energy from 
electromagnetic waves to the electrical energy of electrons in a circuit. The 
same physical antenna can operate in both ways depending on how it is 
used. 

Antennas are all around us. Cell phones and laptops have antennas, 
and antennas are mounted on the roofs of most cars. Antennas relay information 
about the electrical grid to the local power utility, and antennas on 
satellites transmit weather maps to weather stations on earth. Antennas 
are even built into RFID tags on shirts in stores, and these tags are used 
to track inventory and prevent theft. 

Electrical engineers study both electrical energy and electromagnetic 
energy, and the words used to describe these phenomena are similar. Is this 
really an energy conversion process? The answer is yes. Electrical energy 
involves the flow of electrons through a wire. We often think of electrons as 
particles. We often use the term electromagnetic wave to describe the flow 
of electromagnetic energy transmitted by an antenna. However, electrons 
have both wave-like and particle-like properties. Similarly, electromagnetic 
waves have both wave-like and particle-like properties. The wavelengths 
involved are orders of magnitude apart, so it is convenient to only discuss 
either the wave-like or the particle-like properties. There are fundamental 
differences between electricity and electromagnetic waves. Fermions are

elementary particles with half integer spin quantum numbers and with 
quantum mechanical wave functions which are antisymmetric when two 
particles are interchanged [46, p. 391]. Bosons are elementary particles 
with integer spin quantum numbers and with wave functions which are 
symmetric when two particles are interchanged [46, p. 391]. Electrons 
are fermions while electromagnetic waves are bosons. So, antennas are 
energy conversion devices. A complete discussion of the differences between 
fermions and bosons requires the study of quantum mechanics and quantum 
field theory which are beyond the scope of this book. 

An antenna may be as simple as a single metal rod, it may be a copper 
trace on a printed circuit board, it may be a cone shaped horn, or it may be 
a complicated arrangement of multiple wires. Some antennas even resemble 
planar or volume fractals [47] [48]. Hundreds of types of antennas have 
been developed. Seventy five types are discussed in [49], and 91 types are 
discussed in [50]. 

The simplest antenna is just a piece of wire. It may be straight and 
taut, or it may be carelessly strung from a tree. For an antenna designed to 
operate at wavelength , 
the length of the antenna is often approximately 

λ 


2

. 

A straight antenna of length

λ 


2

with signal supplied to the center is 

called a center-fed half-wave dipole or a

2



dipole. Some antennas are placed 

above a conducting plate, or above a conductive surface, which acts as a 

reflector. A straight antenna of around length

4



supplied by a signal at 

one end with a reflector beneath is called a quarter-wave monopole or a 

4



monopole. Figure 4.1 illustrates both dipole and monopole antennas. 

While a random wire will act as an antenna, an antenna with frequency 
response, impedance, radiation pattern, and electromagnetic polarization 
designed for the specific application will perform much more efficiently, and 
these factors are discussed below in Sec. 4.4.

4.2.1 Superposition 
The physics of antenna operation is described by Maxwell's equations. Am-
pere's law, one of Maxwell's equations, was introduced in Section 1.6.1.

In Eq. 4.1, H 
is the magnetic field intensity in mA, D 
is the displacement 



 


flux density in mC 
2 
, and J 
is the current density in mA 
2 
. In the case of 
a transmitting antenna, the current density in the antenna comes from a 

 


 


known source, and the electromagnetic field, described by D 
and H 
, can 
be derived. 

Using Maxwell's equations, we can algebraically derive the electromagnetic 
field only for very simple antennas. The simplest antenna is an infi
nitesimal dipole antenna, also known as a Hertzian dipole. References 



 


[11] derives the electric field intensity, E 
in units mV, for an infinitesimal 
dipole antenna with length dl 
and sinusoidal current I0

For complicated antennas, superposition is used to make the computation 
feasible. To derive the electromagnetic radiation from a complicated 
antenna, small straight antenna segments are considered [15, ch. 10]. The 
electromagnetic radiation from each piece is found, and the principle of 
superposition is the idea that the radiation from the entire antenna is the 
sum of these pieces. The same idea applies to linear circuits. If a circuit has 
a complicated input, the input can be broken up into simpler components. 
Any voltage in the circuit can be found by finding the contribution due to 
each of these components then summing. 

4.2.2 Reciprocity 
Reciprocity is the idea that the behavior of an antenna as a function of 
angle is the same regardless of whether the antenna is being used to send

or receive a signal [15, ch. 10]. A plot of the strength of the field radiated 
from a transmitter as a function of the angles θ 
and φ 
is called a radiation 
pattern plot. Similarly, a plot of the strength of the signal received by 
a receiving antenna as a function of angles θ 
and φ 
assuming a uniform 
field strength is also called a radiation pattern plot. Consider two identical 
antennas, one being used as a transmitter and the other as a receiver. The 
radiation pattern plots will be the same for these two antennas. 

Regardless of the idea of reciprocity, it is often a bad idea to swap the 
transmitting and the receiving antennas of a system because a transmitter 
may be designed to handle much more power than a receiver [15, p. 479]. A 
receiving antenna of effective area A 
at a distance r 
from an antenna which 
transmits uniformly in all directions receives at most only the fraction 4"r 
A 
2 
of the transmitted power [49, p. 4].

For example, consider an antenna that transmits 20 kW of power uniformly 
in all directions. Assume a receiving antenna has an effective area 
of 10 
cm2 
and covers a portion of a spherical shell as shown in Fig. 4.2. 
What is the power received assuming that the antenna is at a distance of 
r

The surface area intercepted by the receiver is 10

the first case, this surface area is the fraction 103 
of the surface sphere of 

4"12 


radius 1 m. At most, the antenna can receive this fraction of the power.

From this example, we can already see some of the advantages and challenges 
in using electromagnetic waves for communication, and we can see 
some of the consequences of antenna design. The transmitted power in this 
example is orders of magnitude larger than the received power. In such a 
situation, the transmitting circuitry and receiving circuitry will look very 
different due to the amount of power and current expected during operation. 
The antennas used will likely also look very different. An antenna 
transmitting kilowatts of power may need to be mounted on a tower while 
a receiving antenna that receives milliwatts of power may be built into a 
portable hand held device. 

A typical radio station may want to transmit throughout a city, a radius 
much larger than 1 km. Furthermore, no energy conversion device is 100% 
efficient. The electrical power at the receiver 1 m away is therefore going to 
be less than 1.6 W, and the power at the receiver 1 km away is going to be 
less than 1:6 
W. Also, all radio receivers are limited by noise. Suppose, for 
example, that this transmitter is placed at the center of a city of radius 1 
km and the receiver can only successfully receive signals with power above 
1 
W due to 1 
W of background noise. A receiver placed 1 km away at 
the edge of the city may be able to receive the signal successfully, while 
a receiver further away in the suburbs may not. However, many receivers 
placed 1 km away with this surface area of 10 
cm2 
could simultaneously 
detect the radio signal. 

If no building in the city is taller than 10 stories, no receivers are likely 
to be found at a height over 30 m, for example, above the surface of the 
earth. However, the transmitter in this example radiates power uniformly 
in all directions including up. We can design antennas which radiate power 
in some directions more than others. If we could focus all power from this 
antenna at altitudes below 30 m, the power at a particular receiver may 
be larger than we calculated above, so a receiver farther away may be able 
to detect the signal. The radiation pattern of an antenna is the spatial 
distribution of the power from the antenna. Radiation pattern plots are 
discussed further in Sec. 4.4.3. 

This example also provides some insights on the safety of working with 
antennas. The 10 
cm2 
surface area in this example is, to an order of 
magnitude, the surface area of a human hand. A typical microwave oven 
uses less power than the transmitter in this example. Kilowatts of power 

 
72 4.2 Electromagnetic Radiation 
are enough to cook with, so for this reason, it would be dangerous to touch 
or even, depending on the frequency, be close to the transmitting antenna. 
The antenna in this example needs to be mounted on an antenna tower 
not only for mechanical reasons but also for safety reasons. The amount 
of power through this surface depends on distance from the transmitter as 
r 
1 
2 
, 
so the danger level is strongly dependent on distance from the antenna. 

4.2.3 Near Field and Far Field 
The region within about a wavelength of an antenna is called the near field 
region. The region beyond multiple wavelengths from an antenna is called 
the far field or Fraunhofer region. For aperture antennas, instead of wire 

antennas, distances larger than 2(aperture size)2 


are considered in the far

λ 


field [15, p. 498]. The radiation pattern in the near field region and in 
the far field region are quite different. Near field electromagnetic radiation 
is used for some specialized applications including tomographic imaging of 
very small objects [51]. However, receiving antennas used for communication 
signals almost always operate in the far field region from transmitting 
antennas. As an example of the difference between near field and far field 
behavior of an antenna, consider the infinitesimal dipole antenna. The 
electric field intensity is given in Eq. 4.2. The near field electric field from 
this infinitesimal antenna is found by taking the limit as r

4.2.4 Environmental Effects on Antennas 
The electromagnetic radiation from an antenna is affected by the environment 
surrounding the antenna, specifically nearby large conductors. 
Sometimes conductors are purposely placed nearby to make an antenna 
directional. Other times, the conductors, like metal roofs or bridges, just 
happen to be nearby. If an antenna is placed near a salty lake, the lake 
surface will reflect the electromagnetic radiation. In other cases, the electrical 
properties of soil underneath an antenna will affect the electromagnetic 
radiation [50, ch. 8] [15, p. 635].

Table 4.1: Conductivity and relative permittivity of different environments, 
[50, ch. 8]. 

Numerical simulations are used to understand how an antenna behaves 
near metal roofs, nearby lakes, or other objects. The effects of the environment 
are modeled by assigning nearby materials an electrical conductivity 
ff, permittivity , 
and permeability . Often the surroundings have µ 
≈ 
0, 
but the other parameters can vary widely. Table 4.1 lists values of electrical 
conductivity and relative permittivity used to model different environments 
as suggested by reference [50, ch. 8]. The values listed are approximates 
due to the variety of environments within each category. Additionally, the 
conductivity can vary from day to day. For example, electromagnetic waves 
may interact with farmland very differently on a snowy winter day, after a 
spring rainfall, and during a dry spell in summer. Also, even for a single 
uniform material, conductivity and permittivity are functions of frequency. 

4.3 Antenna Components and Definitions 
Antennas used for radio frequency communication are made from conducting 
wire elements. These elements may be classified as driven or parasitic 
[50]. All antennas have at least one driven element. In a transmitting antenna, 
power is supplied to the driven element. Current flowing through 
the antenna induces an electromagnetic field around the antenna. In a receiving 
antenna, the driven element is connected to the receiving circuitry. 
Some antennas also have parasitic elements. These elements affect the antenna's 
radiation pattern, but they are not connected to the power supply 
or receiving circuitry [50]. The electric field inside a perfect conductor is 
zero, so putting a good conductor near an antenna influences the antenna's 
radiation pattern. Parasitic elements may be included in the antenna to focus 
the electromagnetic field in a particular direction, alter the bandwidth 
of the antenna, or for other reasons. Antennas are often mounted on a 
metal rod for mechanical support, and this rod is called a boom. 

 
74 4.3 Antenna Components and Definitions 
Antennas may be used individually or as part of an array. Arrays may 
also be driven or parasitic. In a driven array, all elements are connected 
to the power supply or receiving circuitry [50]. In a parasitic array, one or 
more of the elements are parasitic and not connected [50]. Arrays are also 
classified based on the direction of radiation compared to the axis of the 
array. In a broadside array, radiation is mostly perpendicular to the axis of 
the array while in an end fire array, radiation is mostly along the direction 
of the axis of the array [50]. 

A transmission line is a pair of conductors which is used to transmit 
a signal and which is very long compared to the wavelength of the signal 
being sent. Communications engineers and power systems engineers both 
use the term transmission line, but they make different assumptions. To 
a communications engineer, it is a long pair of conductors over which a 
signal is sent. To a power systems engineer, it is a cable that is part of the 
power grid. The communications definition will be used in this text. The 
conductors of a transmission line may be a pair of parallel wires, they may 
be a waveguide formed by a pair of parallel plates, they may be a coax 
cable, or they may have another geometry. Coax cable is formed by a wire 
and cylindrical tube separated by an insulator, both with the same axis, 
so they are coaxial. For example, a coax cable connecting a transmitter 
operating at a frequency of f 
= 
88 
MHz on the first floor of a building and 
an antenna on the top of the tenth floor of the building is a transmission 
line because the length of the cable is long compared to the wavelength of 
λ 
=3:4 
m. As another example, a pair of wires connecting a transmitting 
circuit operating at f 
=4 
GHz on one end of a printed circuit board and 
an antenna on the other end 25 cm away is also a transmission line because 
the length of the wires is long compared to the wavelength of λ 
=7:5 
cm. 

Some antennas have a balun. Balun is a contraction for balanced/ unbalanced. 
It is used between balanced loads and unbalanced transmission 
lines [15, p. 406] [50]. A typical transmission line, made up of a coax 
cable, is constructed from an inner conductor and an outer conductor. 
These conductors have different radii, so they have different impedances. 
The transmission line is called unbalanced due to this impedance difference. 
Suppose that this transmission line is connected to a dipole antenna 
formed from two symmetric conductors. The impedance of the two arms 
of the dipole are equal, so we say that it is a balanced load. A balun can 
used in this type of situation when a balanced antenna is connected to an 
unbalanced transmission line. By properly choosing the impedance of a 
balun, reflections at the interface between the antenna and transmission 
line can be reduced so that more energy gets to or from the antenna and 
less remains stored in the transmission line.

4.4 Antenna Characteristics 
Four main factors which differentiate antennas are frequency response, 
impedance, directivity, and electromagnetic polarization. When selecting 
an antenna for a particular application, these factors should be considered. 
In this section, these and other factors which influence antenna selection 
are discussed. 

4.4.1 Frequency and Bandwidth 
Electromagnetic waves of a wide range of frequencies are used for communication. 
Different names are given to electromagnetic signals at different 
frequency ranges. Table 4.2 lists the name used to refer to various frequency 
bands for which antennas are used. 

Electromagnetic waves are rarely used for communication at the lowest 
frequency band listed in Table 4.2. However, one example was Project 
ELF (short for Extremely Low Frequency). It was a US military radio 
system used to communicate with submarines, and it operated at 76 Hz 
[52]. The array involved 84 miles of antennas spread out near a transmitting 
facilities in northern Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan [52], 
and it operated from 1988 to 2004 [53]. It had an input power of 2.3 MW, 
but only 2.3 W of electromagnetic radiation was transmitted due to the 
fact that the length of the antenna elements used was a small fraction of 
the wavelength. The few watts transmitted were able to reach submarines 
under the ocean throughout the world [52]. Three letter messages took 
15-20 minutes to transmit or receive [52]. 

Antennas are commonly used to transmit and receive electromagnetic 
radiation in the frequency range from 3 
kHz . 
f

THz. However, an 

 
76 4.4 Antenna Characteristics 
antenna designed to operate at 3 kHz looks quite different from an antenna 
designed to operate at 3 THz. Wire-like antennas are used for signals 
roughly in the frequency range 3 
kHz .

3 
GHz. Solid cone, plate-
like, or aperture antennas are used to transmit and receive signals in the 
frequency range 3 
GHz . 
f 
. 
3 
THz [15, ch. 15]. To understand the need 
for different techniques, consider the wavelengths involved. A signal with 
frequency f 
= 
30 
kHz, for example, has a wavelength λ 
=1:00 
· 
104 
m. 
The length of an antenna is often of the same order of magnitude as the 
wavelength. While we can construct wire antennas of this length, they not 
portable. As another example, a wifi signal which operates at 2.5 GHz 
has a wavelength of λ 
= 
12:5 
cm. Wire antennas which are this length are 
easy to build and transport. However, wire antennas designed for signals at 
higher frequencies can be difficult to construct accurately due to their small 
size. For this reason, wire antennas are typically used at lower frequencies 
while cone or plate-like antennas are used higher frequencies.

wavelengths in the range

Antennas are not used to receive and transmit optical signals due to the 
small wavelengths involved even though optical signals obey the same fundamental 
physics as radio frequency electromagnetic radiation. Green light, 
for example, has a wavelength near λ 
= 
500 
nm and a frequency near 61014 
Hz. An antenna designed to transmit and detect this light would need to be 
approximately of length λ 
2 
≈ 
250 
nm. An atom is around 0.1 nm in length, 
so an antenna designed for green light would be only approximately 2500 
atoms long. Antennas of this size would be impractical for many reasons. 
Another reason that different techniques are needed to transmit and receive 
optical signals is that electrical circuits cannot operate at the speed 
of optical frequencies. Techniques for transmitting and detecting optical 
signals are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. 

When selecting an antenna, the range of frequencies that will be transmitted 
or received as well as their bandwidth should be considered. Some 
antennas are designed to operate over a narrow range of frequencies while 
other antennas are designed to operate over a broader band of frequencies. 
An antenna with a narrow bandwidth would be useful in the case when an 
antenna is used to receive signals only in a specific frequency band while 
an antenna with a broad bandwidth would be useful when an antenna is 
to receive signals over a wider frequency range. For example, an antenna 
designed to receive over the air television signals in the US should be designed 
for the broad range from 30 MHz -3 G Hz because television signals 

 
4 ANTENNAS 77 

fall in the VHF and UHF ranges. 

Like all sensors, antennas detect both signal and noise. Noise in a radio 
receiver may be internal to the receiving circuitry or due to external sources 
such as other nearby transmitters [49, p. 4]. An antenna with a broad 
bandwidth will receive more noise due external sources than an antenna 
with a narrow bandwidth. Noise characteristics of an antenna influence the 
ability to receive weak signals, so they should be considered in selecting an 
antenna for an application [50]. 

4.4.2 Impedance 
Both antennas and transmission lines have a characteristic impedance. The 
term transmission line is defined in Sec. 4.3 as a long pair of conductors. If 
the length of the conductors is long compared to the wavelength of signal 
transmitted, the voltage and current may vary along the length of the line, 
and energy may be stored in the line. For this reason, transmission lines 
are described by a characteristic impedance in ohms. The characteristic 
impedance gives the ratio of voltage to current along the line, and it provides 
information on the ability of the transmission line to store energy 
in the electric and magnetic field. Typical values for the impedance of 
transmission lines used for communications are 50 or 75 
. Similarly, each 
antenna has its own characteristic impedance, measured in ohms, which 
represents the ratio of voltage to current in the antenna. 

Why is the impedance important? Transmitting antennas are often 
physically removed from the signal source and connected by a transmission 
line. Similarly, receiving antennas are often in a different location than 
receiving circuitry and connected by a transmission line. To efficiently 
transmit a signal between transmitting or receiving circuitry and an antenna, 
the impedance between the antenna and transmission line should 
be matched. In this case, where the characteristic impedance of the line 
and antenna are equal, energy flows along the transmission line between 
the circuitry and the antenna. Transmission lines are made from good, but 
not perfect, conductors. A small amount of energy may be converted to 
heat due to the resistance in the lines, but this amount of energy is often 
trivial. However, if there is an impedance mismatch between the antenna 
and the transmission line, reflections will be set up at the transmission line 
antenna interface. Less energy will be transmitted to or from the antenna 
because energy will be stored in the line, and the amount of energy involved 
may be significant. In a properly designed system were the impedances of 
the antenna and the transmission line are matched, no reflection occurs, so 
as much energy as possible is transmitted to or from the antenna. 

 
78 4.4 Antenna Characteristics 
Impedance of an antenna is a function of frequency. Antennas transmit 
and receive communications signals which are almost never sinusoids of a 
single frequency. Often, however, the signals contain only components with 
frequencies within a narrow band. For example, a radio station may have a 
carrier frequency of 100 MHz, and it may transmit signals with frequency 
components 99:99 
MHz <f< 
100:01 
MHz. In this case, the impedance of 
the antenna may be approximated by the impedance at 100 MHz. 

4.4.3 Directivity 
Antennas can be designed to radiate energy equally in all directions. Alternatively, 
antennas can be designed to radiate energy primarily along a 
single direction. Directivity D 
is a unitless measure of the uniformity of 
the radiation pattern plot. It is defined as the ratio of the maximum power 
density over the average power density. 

Maximum power density radiated by antenna 

D 
= 
(4.8)

Average power density radiated by antenna 

An antenna which radiates equally in all directions is called isotropic. 
An antenna that radiates equally in two, but not the third, direction is 
called omnidirectional [15]. For example, an omnidirectional antenna may 
radiate equally in all horizontal directions but not the vertical direction. 
Isotropic antennas have D 
=1 
while all other antennas have D> 
1. 
Some 
applications require an isotropic antenna. For example, a radio station in 
the center of a town might use an isotropic or omnidirectional antenna 
to transmit to all of the town. In other cases, a directional antenna is 
preferred. A stationary weather station that transmits data to a fixed base 
station would be wasting energy using an isotropic antenna because it could 
use less transmitted power with the same received power using a directional 
antenna. 

Received power may be larger than given by Eq. 4.3 if directional 
antennas are used instead of isotropic antennas. For a transmitting antenna 
with gain Gtrans 
and a receiving antenna with gain Grec 
compared to an 
isotropic antenna, Eq. 4.3 becomes

Equation 4.9 is known as the Friis equation [55]. Received power will be 
less than given by Eq. 4.3 or 4.9 due to losses in the air or other material 
through which the signal travels and due to a difference in electromagnetic 
polarization between the transmitter and receiver [49, p. 4]. 

Directivity is a rough measure of an antenna. A more accurate measure 
is a radiation pattern plot. The radiation pattern plot is a graphical 
representation of intensity of radiation with respect to position throughout 
space. A radiation pattern plot may be a 3D plot or a pair of 2D plots. In 
the case where two 2D plots are used, one of the plots is an azimuth plot 
and the other is an elevation plot. The azimuth plot shows a horizontal 
slice of the 3D radiation pattern, parallel to the xy plane. The elevation 
plot shows a vertical slice, perpendicular to the xy plane. Most radiation 
pattern plots, including all shown in this text, are labeled by the amplitude 
of the electric field [15] [56]. However, occasionally they are labeled by 
the amplitude of the power instead. The radiation pattern of an antenna 
is quite different in the near field, at a distance less than about a wavelength, 
and in the far field, with distances much greater than a wavelength. 
Radiation pattern plots illustrate the far field behavior only. 

Figure 4.3 shows the radiation pattern plot for a half-wave dipole antenna 
in free space, and it was plotted using the software EZNEC [56]. The 
acronym NEC stands for Numerical Electromagnetics Code. The figure in 
the upper left is the azimuth plot, the figure in the upper right is the elevation 
plot, the figure in the lower left is a 3D radiation pattern plot, and 
the figure in the lower right is the antenna layout. 

Figure 4.4 shows the radiation pattern plots for a 15-meter quad antenna. 
Distinct lobes and nulls are apparent. 

Front to back ratio (F/B ratio) is a measure related to directivity that 
can be found from the azimuth radiation pattern plot. By definition, it is 
the ratio of the strength of the power radiated in the front to the back. 
Often, the front direction is chosen to be the direction of largest magnitude 
in the radiation pattern plot, and the back direction is the opposite 
direction. F/B ratio can be specified either on a log scale in units of dB or 
on a linear scale which is unitless. It can also be defined either as a ratio 
of the strength of the electric field intensities or as a ratio of the strengths 
of the powers, but most often power is used.

When selecting an antenna, many decisions related to the antenna directivity 
are needed. A particular application may require an isotropic or 
a directional antenna. If a directional antenna is needed, the magnitude 
of the directivity must be decided. Additionally, the orientation of the 
antenna must be decided so that nodes and nulls are in the appropriate 
directions. Both the azimuth angle and the elevation angle of the nodes 
and nulls should be considered [50, p. 22-1]. 

 
82 4.4 Antenna Characteristics 
4.4.4 Electromagnetic Polarization 
The electromagnetic wave emanating from a transmitting antenna is de


 


 


scribed by an electric field E 
and a magnetic field H 
. The wave necessarily 
has both an electric field and a magnetic field because, according to 
Maxwell's equations, time varying electric fields induce time varying magnetic 
fields, and time varying magnetic fields induce electric fields. At any 
point in space and at any time, the direction of the electric field, the direction 
of the magnetic field, and the direction of propagation of the wave 
are all mutually perpendicular. More specifically, 

" " 

!

 


Direction of E 
× 
Direction of H =(Direction of propagation) 
. 
(4.18) 
An electromagnetic wave which varies with position in the same way 
that it varies with time is called a plane wave because planar wavefronts 
propagate at constant velocity in a given direction. For example, a sinusoidal 
plane wave which travels in the positive a^z 
direction is described 
by 

 
 

E 
= 
E0 
cos 
106t 
 
300za^x. 
(4.19) 

 


 


For this plane wave, E 
is directed along a^x, H 
is directed along a^y, and 
the wave propagates in the a^z 
direction. As another example, consider the 
plane wave described by 

 
 " 
a^x 
+^ay 
" 

E 
= 
E0 
cos 
106t 
 
300z 
√ 
. 
(4.20)

2 




 


For this plane wave, the direction of E 
is 450 
from the a^x 
axis, the direction 

 


of  
H 
is 450 
from the a^y 
axis, and again it propagates in the a^z 
direction. 
Both of these electric fields describe sinusoidal plane waves because the 
electric field varies with position as it does with time, sinusoidally in both 
cases. 

We can classify plane waves by their electromagnetic polarization. Plane 
waves can be classified as linearly polarized, left circularly polarized, right 
circularly polarized, left elliptically polarized, or right elliptically polarized. 
In a previous chapter, we encountered the distinctly different idea of material 
polarization. Appendix C discusses overloaded terminology including 
the term polarization. 

Both of the electromagnetic waves described by Eq. 4.19 and by Eq. 

4.20 are linearly polarized. In both cases, the direction of the electric field 
remains constant as the wave propagates with respect to both position and 
time. If the direction of the electric field rotates uniformly around the 
 
4 ANTENNAS 83 

axis formed by the direction of propagation, the wave is called circularly 
polarized. If the direction of the electric field rotates nonuniformly, the wave 
is called elliptically polarized. For circularly polarized waves, the projection 
of the wave on a plane perpendicular to the axis formed by the direction 
of propagation is circular. For elliptical waves, the projection is elliptical. 
To determine if the polarization is left or right, point your right thumb in 
the direction of propagation, and compare the rotation of the electric field 
to the rotation of your fingers. If the rotation is along the direction of the 
fingers of your right hand, the wave is right polarized. Otherwise, it is left 
polarized. For example, the wave described by

What does electromagnetic polarization have to do with antennas? Antennas 
may be designed to transmit linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized 
signals. Antennas designed to transmit or receive circularly polarized 
signals often contain wires that coil in the corresponding direction around 
an axis. If a signal is transmitted with an antenna designed to transmit linearly 
polarized waves, the best antenna to use as a receiver will be one that 
is also designed for linearly polarized waves. The signal can be detected by 
an antenna designed for signal of a different electromagnetic polarization, 
but the received signal will be noisier or weaker. Similarly, if a signal is 
transmitted with an antenna designed for right circular polarization, the 
best receiving antenna to use will be one also designed for right circular 
polarization.

4.4.5 Other Antenna Considerations 
Antennas are made from good conductors. In Chapters 2 and 3, we saw 
that the materials that make up many energy conversion devices strongly 
influence the behavior. While the conductivity of conductors vary, overall 
the material that an antenna is made from does not significantly affect its 
behavior. In addition to bandwidth, impedance, directivity, and electromagnetic 
polarization, other factors, such as size, shape and configuration, 
distinguish one antenna from another. Mechanical factors should be considered 
too. An ideal antenna may be one that is easy to construct or mount 
in the desired location, is portable, or requires little maintenance [50]. If an 
antenna is to be mounted outside, the antenna should be able to withstand 
snow, wind, ice, and other extreme weather [50]. While Maxwell's equations 
are useful for predicting the radiation pattern of an antenna, they do 
not provide information about these other factors. 

There is no perfect antenna. In one case, the best antenna may be a 
Yagi which is very directional and designed to operate within a narrow 
frequency band. In another application, the best antenna may be mechanically 
strong and mounted in a way to withstand extreme wind [50, 

p. 17-29]. In another case, the best antenna may be portable and easy 
to set up by one person regardless of its radiation pattern [50, p. 21-26]. 
In another case, the best antenna may be a wire of an arbitrary length 
hanging from a tree because it was the easiest and quickest to construct. 
As with any branch of engineering, antenna design involves trade offs. For 
example, the best antenna to detect an 800 MHz linearly polarized signal 
is an antenna that is designed to detect 800 MHz signals, is designed to 
detect linearly polarized signals, is oriented in the proper direction, and 
has an impedance matched to the impedance of the transmission line used. 
The signal can still be detected using an antenna designed for a different 
frequency, designed for a different electromagnetic polarization, improperly 
directed, or with mismatched impedance. However, in all of these cases, a 
less intense signal will be received.

5 Hall Effect 

5.1 Introduction 
In this chapter we discuss another type of inductive energy conversion device, 
the Hall effect device. While these devices may be made from conductors, 
they are more often made from semiconductors, like silicon, which 
are easily integrated into microelectronics. The Hall effect was discovered 
using gold by Edwin Hall in 1879 [57]. The first practical devices were 
produced in the 1950s and 1960s when uniform semiconductor materials 
were first manufactured [57]. 

Hall effect sensors are used to measure some hard to observe quantities. 
Without external tools, humans cannot detect magnetic field. However, a 
small, inexpensive Hall effect sensor can act as a magnetometer. Also, the 
Hall effect can be used to determine if a semiconductor is n-type or p-type. 
One of the first applications of Hall effect devices was in computer keyboard 
buttons [57]. Today, Hall effect devices are used to measure the rotation 
speed of a motor, as flow rate sensors, in multiple types of automotive 
sensors, and in many other applications. 

5.2 Physics of the Hall Effect 
Hall effect devices are direct energy conversion devices that convert energy 
from a magnetic field to electricity. The physics behind these devices is 
described by the Lorentz force equation. This discussion follows references 

[3] and [9]. If we place a charge in an external electric field, it will feel a 
force parallel to the applied electric field. If we place a moving charge in 
an external magnetic field, it will feel a force perpendicular to the applied 
magnetic field. The Lorentz force equation

describes the forces on the moving charge due to the external electric and 



 


magnetic fields. In the above equation, F 
represents force in newtons on

a charge moving with velocity

The quantity E 
represents 



 


the electric field intensity in units mV, and B 
represents the magnetic flux 
density in units Wb. Charge in coulombs is denoted by Q. 
Notice that the 

m

2 
force on the charge due to the electrical field points in the same direction 
as the electrical field while the force on the charge due to the magnetic field 
points perpendicularly to both the velocity of the charge and the direction 
of the magnetic field. 

 
92 5.2 Physics of the Hall Effect 
The Hall effect occurs in both conductors and semiconductors. In conductors, 
electrons are the charge carriers responsible for the effect while in 
semiconductors, both electrons and holes are the charge carriers responsible 
for the effect [9]. A hole is the absence of an electron. Consider a 
piece of semiconductor oriented as shown in Fig. 5.1a. Assume the length 
is specified by l, 
the width is specified w, 
and the thickness is specified 
by dthick. For a typical Hall effect device, these dimensions may be in the 
millimeter range. Furthermore, assume the semiconductor is p-type with 
hole concentration p 
in units m3 
. The charge concentration represents the 
net, or excess, charge density above a neutral material. Materials with a 
net negative charge, excess valence electrons, will have a positive value for 
the electron concentration n 
and are called n-type. Materials with a net 
positive charge, an excess of holes, will have a positive value for the hole 
concentration p 
which represents the density of holes in the material and 
are called p-type. Overall charge density is related to n 
and p 
by 

ch 
= 
qn 
+ 
qp 
(5.2) 

where q 
is the magnitude of the charge of an electron. 

Assume the semiconductor is placed in an external magnetic field oriented 
in the a^z 
direction, with magnetic flux density 



 


B 
= 
Bza^z. 


Also assume a current is supplied through the semiconductor in the a^x 
direction. The positive charge carriers in the semiconductor, holes, move 

!

with velocity  
v 
= 
vxa^x 
because current is the flow of charge per unit 
time. These measures are illustrated in Fig. 5.1b. Hall effect devices are 
typically used as sensors as opposed to energy harvesting devices because 
power must be supplied from this external current and because the amount 
of electricity produced is typically quite small. 

The force on the charges can be found from the Lorentz force equation. 
The force due to the external magnetic field on a charge of magnitude q

and is oriented in the a^y 
direction. Positive charges accumulate on one 
side of the semiconductor as shown in Fig. 5.1c. This charge build up 
causes an electric field oriented in the a^y 
direction which opposes further 
charge build up. Charges accumulate until an equilibrium is reached when 
the forces on the charges in the a^y 
direction are zero.

A magnetometer is a device that measures magnetic field. To use a 

Hall effect device as a magnetometer, start with a piece of semiconductor 
of known dimensions and known charge concentration, and then apply a 
current. If the voltage perpendicular to the current is measured, the magnetic 
field can be calculated. The measured voltage is proportional to the 
strength of the external magnetic flux density.

Voltage is easily measured with a voltmeter, so no specialized tools are 
needed. To reliably measure this voltage, it is often amplified. 

Alternatively, if the strength of an external magnetic field is known, the 
Hall effect can be used to measure the concentrations of holes or electrons 
in a piece of semiconductor. With some algebra, we can write the hole concentration 
as a function of the dimensions of the semiconductor, the known 
magnetic field strength, the applied current, and the measured voltage.

An analogous expression can be found if electrons instead of holes are the 
dominant charge carrier. The sign of this measured voltage is also used to 
determine whether a piece of semiconductor is n-type or p-type [58]. 

The Hall resistance RH 
is a parameter inversely proportional to the 
charge concentration, and it has the units of ohms [9] [59]. For the assumptions

96 5.3 Magnetohydrodynamics 

This amount of power is tiny. While this device can make a useful sensor, 
it will not make a useful energy harvesting device. It generates tens of 
picowatts of power, and a 1 mA current must be supplied to generate the 
power. 

5.3 Magnetohydrodynamics 
A magnetohydrodynamic device converts magnetic energy to or from electrical 
energy through the use of a conductive liquid or plasma. Similar to 
the Hall effect, the fundamental physics of the magnetohydrodynamic effect 
is described by the Lorentz force equation, Eq. 5.1. The difference is that 
the magnetohydrodynamic effect occurs in conductive liquids or plasmas 
while the Hall effect occurs in solid conductors or solid semiconductors. Another 
related effect, which is also described by the Lorentz force equation, 
is the electrohydrodynamic effect, discussed in Sec. 10.6. The difference 
is that the magnetohydrodynamic effect involves magnetic fields while the 
electrohydrodynamic effect involves electric fields. 

Matter can be found in solid, liquid, or gas state. A plasma is another 
possible state of matter. A plasma is composed of charged particles, but a 
plasma has no net charge. When a solid is heated, it melts into a liquid. 
When a liquid is heated, it evaporates into a gas. When a gas is heated, the 
particles will collide with each other so often that the gas becomes ionized. 
This ionized gas is a plasma [3]. When ions in either a conductive liquid 
or a plasma flow in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the 
flow of ions, a voltage is produced. 

This magnetohydrodynamic effect was first observed by Faraday in 1831 
[3]. In the 1960s, there was interest in building magnetohydrodynamic devices 
where the conducting medium was a plasma. These devices typically 
operated at high temperatures, in the range of 3000-4000 K [60]. Progress 
was limited, however, because few materials can withstand such high temperatures. 
More recently, engineers have used this principle to build pumps, 
valves, and other devices for microfluidic systems [61] [62]. These room 
temperature devices can control the flow of conducting liquids through the 
use of an external magnetic field. 

 
5 HALL EFFECT 97 

5.4 Quantum Hall Effect 
Around a hundred years after the discovery of the Hall effect, the quantum 
Hall effect was discovered. Klaus von Klitzing discovered the integer quantum 
Hall effect in 1980 and won the physics Nobel prize for it in 1985 [63]. 
In 1998, Robert Laughlin, Horst St

ormer, and Daniel Tsui won the physics 
Nobel prize for the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect [64]. The 
integer quantum Hall effect is observed in two dimensional electron gases 
which can occur, for example, in an inversion layer at the interface between 
the semiconductor and insulator in a MOSFET [59]. As in the Hall effect, 
a current is applied in one direction, and the Hall voltage is measured in 
the perpendicular direction. Following Fig. 5.1, assume that a current is 
applied along the a^x 
direction in the presence of an external magnetic field 
in the a^z 
direction. The voltage VAB 
is measured, and Hall resistance RH 
is calculated. The quantum Hall effect is observed at low temperatures and 
in the presence of strong applied magnetic fields. In such situations, the 
Hall resistance has the form 

h 


RH 
= 
(5.19) 

q2 
· 
n 


where h 
=6:626 
· 
1034 
Js is the Planck constant and n 
is an integer [59]. 
This effect is called the quantum Hall effect because RH 
can take only discrete 
values corresponding to integer values. Values of the Hall resistance 
can be measured extremely accurately, to 2.3 parts in 1010 
[59]. The fractional 
quantum Hall effect is observed in highly ordered two dimensional 
electron gases in the presence of very strong magnetic fields, and it involves 
quantum mechanical electron-electron interactions [65]. 

The formal definition of the ohm relies on definitions of the meter, kilogram, 
and second. The kilogram is defined with respect to the weight of 
a physical object made of platinum and iridium housed in the International 
Bureau of Weights and Measures in France [59]. Multiple national 
labs, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the 
United States, have come up with an experimental means of defining the 
ohm involving the quantum Hall effect. This standardized definition of the 
ohm is accurate to one part in 109 
which is more accurate than previous 
definitions involving the kilogram, meter, and second [59]. Because of the 
high accuracy with which the integer quantum Hall effect can be measured, 
scientists have proposed using experiments involving it to standardize the 
measurement of the Planck constant and the definition of the kilogram 
instead of relying on a definition involving a physical object. These new 
standards have not been adopted yet, but they may be implemented as 
early as 2019 [66]. 

 
98 5.5 Applications of Hall Effect Devices 
5.5 Applications of Hall Effect Devices 
A Hall effect device is a simple device. It is essentially a piece of semiconductor 
with leads connected and calibrated for use. For this reason, Hall 
effect devices are inexpensive, small, and readily available. As with most 
integrated circuits, these devices are durable and long lasting because they 
have no mechanical moving parts [57]. 

Hall effect devices are available in two types: analog and digital. Analog 
Hall effect devices are typically integrated with an amplifier and circuitry 
to make the output more linear [57]. Some devices also contain circuitry 
to make the devices stable over a wider temperature range because the 
output of Hall effect sensors may be slightly temperature dependent [57]. 
The operating output voltage range of these devices is often limited by the 
amplifier circuit as opposed to the Hall effect sensor [57]. Digital Hall effect 
devices contain the Hall effect sensor integrated with additional circuitry 
such as a comparator to produce a digital output [57]. 

Analog Hall effect devices are used to sense magnetic field, temperature, 
current, pressure, position, and other parameters [57]. To make a Hall 
effect temperature sensor, for example, a magnet is mounted on a material 
that contracts or expands in the presence of a temperature change. As 
the magnet moves, it changes the magnetic field in a nearby Hall effect 
device and thereby generates a voltage across the Hall effect device. The 
same effect can be used to measure pressure or other parameters using 
a material that expands or contracts when the pressure changes or other 
parameter changes. Current flowing through a wire generates a magnetic 
field surrounding the wire. For this reason, the Hall effect can be used to 
make an ammeter that can be mounted nearby, as opposed to in the path 
of, the current. 

Digital Hall effect devices are used as switches or as buttons in a keyboard. 
If a small magnet is mounted in a button, a Hall effect device can 
be used to sense when that magnet is pressed down near the Hall effect 
sensor. Hall effect devices can also be used as proximity sensors to detect 
the presence of nearby ferromagnetic objects [57]. Additionally, digital Hall 
effect devices are used in magnetic card readers [57]. One of the most common 
applications is in tachometers, devices that measure rotation speed. 
To measure the rotation speed of a motor for example, the Hall effect sensor 
is mounted near a ferromagnetic gear. See Fig. 5.2. As a gear tooth 
passes the sensor, the magnetic field at the sensor changes, and a voltage 
is induced across the Hall effect device. Hall effect sensors are used 
to measure rotation speed of motors, fans, tape machines, and disk drives 
[57]. Relatedly, Hall effect devices are used as flow rate sensors. These 

 
5 HALL EFFECT 99 

motorHall effect device
Figure 5.2: Placement of Hall effect sensor used as a tachometer. 

sensors are found in devices ranging from water softeners to ocean current 
monitors [57]. To detect flow rate, a blade is mounted so that it rotates 
in the water flow. Magnets are mounted on the blade, and the Hall effect 
sensor is mounted nearby. When the blade passes the sensor, the magnetic 
field at the sensor changes and induces a voltage in the Hall effect sensor. 
Following the same principle, Hall effect sensors are used to measure the 
speed of paper flow in copiers, needles in sewing machines, drill bits in 
drilling machines, and bottles in bottling factories [57]. 

Multiple types of Hall effect devices are used in cars. Hall effect sensors 
are used as rotation sensors to detect transmission speed [57]. They are 
used as proximity sensors to detect the shift lever position, crank shaft 
position, and throttle position [57]. They are also used in door interlocks, 
in brake skidding detection, and in traction control systems [57].

6 Photovoltaics 

6.1 Introduction 
This chapter discusses solar cells and optical detectors, both of which are 
devices that convert optical electromagnetic energy to electricity. The next 
chapter discusses lamps, LEDs, and lasers which convert energy in the opposite 
direction. The photovoltaic effect is the idea that if a light shines on 
a pure piece of semiconductor, electron-hole pairs form. In the presence of 
an external electric field, these charges are swept apart, and a voltage develops 
across the terminals of the semiconductor. It was first demonstrated 
in 1839 by Edmond Becquerel. In a photovoltaic device, also called a solar 
cell, this effect typically occurs at a semiconductor pn junction. This same 
effect occurs on a smaller scale in photodiodes used to detect light and 
in optical sensors in digital cameras. To understand the physics behind 
these devices, we need to further study crystallography in semiconductors. 
Energy level diagrams, which illustrate the energy needed to remove an 
electron from a material, are another topic studied in this chapter. 

Unlike fossil fuel based power plants, photovoltaic cells produce energy 
without contributing to pollution. The solar power industry is growing at 
a fast pace. Worldwide as of April 2017, photovoltaic cells were capable of 
generating over 303 GW of power, and 75 GW of this total was installed 
within the past year [67]. This generating capacity was sufficient to satisfy 
1.8% of the worldwide demand for electricity [67]. In the United States as 
of April 2017, photovoltaic cells installed were capable of generating 14.7 
GW [67]. 

6.2 The Wave and Particle Natures of Light 
The physics of electromagnetic radiation is described by Maxwell's equations, 
Eqs. 1.5 -1.8, and discussed in Sections 1.6.1 and 4.4.1. Optical 
energy is electromagnetic energy with wavelengths roughly in the range 

400 
nm . 
λ 
. 
650 
nm. 


This wavelength range corresponds to the frequency range 

4:6 
· 
1014 
Hz . 
f 
. 
7:5 
· 
1014 
Hz. 
We often think of electromagnetic radiation as behaving like a wave. However, 
it has both wave-like and particle-like behavior. 

One way to understand light is to think of it as composed of particles 
called photons. A quantum is a small chunk, and a photon is a quantum, 

 
102 6.2 The Wave and Particle Natures of Light 

small chunk, of light. A related quantity is a phonon, which is a quanta, 
or small chunk, of lattice vibrations. We will discuss phonons in a later 
section, and they do not relate to light. Although, phonons can perturb 
light, and that is the basis for acousto-optic devices. The second way to 
understand light is to think of it as a wave with a wavelength λ 
measured 
in nm. White light has a broad bandwidth while the light produced by a 
laser has a very narrow bandwidth. 

These two descriptions of light complement each other. A photon is the 
smallest unit of light, and it has a particular wavelength. The energy of a 
photon of light with wavelength λ 
is given by 

hc 


E

In SI units, energy is measured in joules. However, other units are sometimes

Why do we talk about radio waves but not radio particles while we treat 
light as both wave-like and particle-like? A person is around 1.5 to 2 m 
tall. The wavelength of the radio station broadcast in the example above 
was RF 
≈ 
3:4 
m while the wavelength of blue light was blue 
light 
≈ 
400 
nm. Both radio frequency and optical signals are electromagnetic radiation. 
Both are well described by Maxwell's equations. Both have wave-like and 
particle-like properties. Humans typically talk about the wave-like nature 
of radio waves because they are on a scale we can measure with a meter 

 
104 6.3 Semiconductors and Energy Level Diagrams 

stick. However, with the correct tools, we can observe both the wave-like 
and particle-like behavior of light. 

Why is UV light more dangerous than visible light? Why are x-rays so 
dangerous? Each photon of x-ray radiation has around a thousand times 
more energy than a photon of green light. This type of radiation is called 
ionizing radiation because each photon has enough energy to rip an electron 
from skin or muscles. UV radiation also has enough energy per photon 
to rip an electron off while red light and blue light do not have enough energy. 
Photons of radio frequency and microwave electromagnetic radiation 
contain nowhere near enough energy per photon to do this damage. These 
types of radiation can still pose a safety hazard if enough photons land on 
your skin. Microwave ovens are used to cook food. However, they do not 
pose the hazards of ionizing radiation. 

6.3 Semiconductors and Energy Level Diagrams 
6.3.1 Semiconductor Definitions 
Some semiconductors are made up of atoms of a single type like pure Si 
or pure Ge. Others contain a combination of elements in column 13 and 
column 15 of the periodic table. Semiconductors of this type include AlAs, 
AlSb, GaAs, and InP. Other semiconductors contain a combination of elements 
in columns 12 and 16 of the periodic table. Examples of this type 
include ZnTe, CdSe, and ZnS [9]. Most semiconductors involve elements 
located somewhere near silicon on the periodic table, but more complicated 
compositions and structures are also possible. Materials made from three 
different elements of the periodic table are called ternary compounds, and 
materials made from four elements are called quaternary compounds. 

To understand the operation of devices like solar cells, photodetectors, 
and LEDs, we need to study the flow of charges in semiconductors. Electrical 
properties in semiconductors are determined by the flow of both valence 
electrons and holes. Valence electrons, as opposed to inner shell electrons, 
are the electrons most easily ripped off an atom. A hole is an absence 
of an electron. Valence electrons and holes are known as charge carriers 
because they are charged and they move through the semiconductor 
when an external voltage is applied. At a finite temperature, electrons are 
continuously in motion, and some electron-hole pairs may form an exciton. 
These electron-hole pairs naturally combine, also called decay, within 
a short time. However, at any time, some charge carriers are present in 
semiconductors at temperatures above absolute zero due to the motion of 
charges. 

 
6 PHOTOVOLTAICS 105 

Crystalline semiconductors can be classified as intrinsic or extrinsic [9, 

p. 65]. An intrinsic semiconductor crystal is a crystal with no lattice 
defects or impurities. At absolute zero, T 
=0 
K, an intrinsic semiconductor 
has no free electrons or holes. All valence electrons are involved in chemical 
bonds, and there are no holes. At finite temperature, some charge carriers 
are present due to the motion of electrons at finite temperature. The 
holes

concentration of these charge carriers is measured in units electrons, ,

m
m
3 
m3 
electrons holes

or .The intrinsic carrier concentration is the density of

cm3 
cm3 
electrons in a pure semiconductor, and it is a function of the temperature T 
. 
At higher temperatures, more charge carriers will be present even if there 
are no impurities or defects in the crystalline semiconductor due to more 
motion of charges. If we apply a voltage across an intrinsic semiconductor 
at T 
=0 
K, no charges flow. When the equilibrium concentration of 
electrons n 
or holes p 
is different from the intrinsic carrier concentration 
ni 
then we say that the semiconductor is extrinsic. If either impurities or 
crystal defects are present, the material will be extrinsic. If a voltage is 
applied across an extrinsic semiconductor at T 
=0 
K, charges will flow. If 
a voltage is applied across either an extrinsic or intrinsic semiconductor at 
temperatures above absolute zero, charge carriers will be present and will 
flow. 

The process of introducing more electrons or holes into a semiconductor 
is called doping. A semiconductor with an excess of electrons compared 
to an intrinsic semiconductor is called n-type. A semiconductor with an 
excess of holes is called p-type. Silicon typically has four valence electrons 
which are involved in bonding. Phosphorous has five valence electrons, and 
aluminum has three. When a phosphorous atom replaces a silicon atom in 
a silicon crystal, it is called a donor because it donates an electron. When 
an aluminum atom replaces a silicon atom, it is called an acceptor. Column 
15 elements are donors to silicon and column 13 elements are acceptors. If 
silicon is an impurity in AlP, it may act as a donor or acceptor. If it replaces 
an aluminum atom, it acts as a donor. If it replaces a phosphorous atom, 
it acts as an acceptor. 

How can we dope a piece of silicon? More specifically, how can we dope 
a semiconductor with boron? Boron is sold at some hardware stores. It is 
sometimes used as an ingredient in soap. Start with a silicon wafer, and 
remove any oxide which has formed on the surface. Each silicon atoms 
forms bonds with four nearest neighbors. At the surface though, there is 
no fourth neighbor, so silicon atoms bond with oxygen from the air. Smear 
some boron onto the wafer, or place a chunk of boron on top of the wafer. 
Place it in a furnace at slightly less than silicon's melting temperature, 

 
106 6.3 Semiconductors and Energy Level Diagrams 

around 1000 
C. Some boron will diffuse in and replace silicon atoms. 
Remove the excess boron. The same procedure can be used to dope with 
other donors or acceptors. What is the most dangerous part of the process? 
Etching the oxide off the silicon because hydrofluoric acid HF, a dangerous 
acid, is used [69]. 

Sometimes it is possible to grow one layer of a semiconductor material 
on top of a layer of a different type of material. A stack of different 
semiconductors on top of each other is called a heterostructure. Not all 
materials can be made into heterostructures. GaAs and AlAs have almost 
the same atomic spacings, so heterostructures of these materials can be 
formed. The spacing between atoms, also called lattice constant, in AlAs is 

0.546 nm, and the spacing between atoms in GaAs is 0.545 nm [9]. If the 
atomic spacing in the two materials is too different, mechanical strain in 
the resulting material will pull it apart. Even moderate mechanical strain 
can negatively impact optical properties of a device because defects may 
be introduced at the interface between the materials. These defects can 
introduce additional energy levels which can trap charge carriers. 
6.3.2 Energy Levels in Isolated Atoms and in Semiconductors 
In a solar cell, light shining on a semiconductor causes electrons to flow 
which allows the device to convert light to electricity. How much energy 
does it take to cause an electron in a semiconductor to flow? To answer 
this question, we will look at energy levels of:

Aluminum has an electron configuration of 1s22s22p63s23p1 
. It has 13 total 
electrons, and it has 3 valence electrons. More specifically, it has two valence 
electrons in the 3s subshell and one in the 3p subshell. Phosphorous 
has an electron configuration of 1s22s22p63s23p3 
, so it has 5 valence electrons. 
Ideas in this section apply to materials regardless of whether they 
are crystalline, amorphous, or polycrystalline.

Energy Levels of Electrons of Isolated Al and Isolated P Atoms at T 
=0 
K 

To understand the interaction of light and a semiconductor, start by considering 
an isolated Al atom and an isolated P atom at absolute zero, 
T 
=0 
K. 
How much energy does it take to rip off electrons of Al? It takes 
significantly less energy to rip off a valence electron than an electron from 
an inner shell. In fact, when we say an electron is a valence electron, or 
an electron is in a valence shell, we mean that the electron is in the shell 
for which it takes the least energy to rip off an electron. We do not mean 
that the electron is further from the nucleus, although often it is. When 
we say an electron is in an inner shell, we mean the electron is in a shell 
for which it takes more energy to rip off an electron. This text focuses on 
energy conversion devices which operate at moderate energies, so all of the 
devices discussed involve interactions of only valence electrons. Inner shell 
electrons will not be involved. It is also possible to excite, but not rip off, 
an electron. When an electron is excited, its internal momentum changes 
and its quantum numbers change. The terms valence electron and quantum 
number were both defined in Sec. 1.5.2. Less energy is required to excite 
than rip off an electron. The energy required to excite or rip off electrons 
can be supplied by thermal energy, an external voltage, an external optical 
field, or other external sources. 

Figure 6.1 is a plot of the energy required to excite or remove electrons 
from an isolated neutral Al atom at T 
=0 
K. 
The figure was plotted 
using data from [70]. While energy levels are drawn using actual data, 
the thickness of the lines is not drawn to scale. Energy is on the vertical 
axis. Allowed energy levels are shown by horizontal lines. Each electron 
can only have energy corresponding to one of these discrete possible energy 
levels. At T 
=0 
K, 
electrons occupy the lowest possible energy levels. One 
electron can occupy each line, so the lowest 13 energy levels are occupied by 
electrons. While not shown due to the resolution of the figure, the density 
of allowed energy levels increases as energy approaches zero at the top of 
the figure. Since we are considering the case of absolute zero temperature, 
these upper energy levels are not occupied by electrons. 

The left side of Fig. 6.2 replots the allowed energy levels of the electrons 
in an isolated Al atom at T 
=0 
K. 
The energy levels are also labeled. The 
right side of the figure plots the allowed energy levels of electrons in an 
isolated P atom also at T 
=0 
K. 
Data on phosphorous energy levels also 
comes from [70]. As with the Al atom, the electrons of the P atom can 
only occupy certain specific discrete energy levels. Since the atoms are at 
absolute zero, the electrons occupy the lowest energy levels possible. Figure 

 
110 6.3 Semiconductors and Energy Level Diagrams 

6.3 contains the same information, but is zoomed in vertically to show the 
valence electron levels more clearly. 
The P atom has two more electrons than the Al atom. Phosphorous 
atoms have more protons, so the electrons are a bit more tightly bound to 
the nucleus. For this reason, it takes a bit more energy to rip the electrons 
off, and the allowed energy levels are a bit different than for Al. 

The amount of energy required to rip a 3p electron off the atom is 
the vertical distance from the 3p level to the ground line at the top of the 
figure. The amount of energy required to rip a 2p electron off is the vertical 
distance from the 2p level to the ground line. As expected, these figures 
show that it requires more energy to rip off the inner shell 2p electron than 
the valence shell 3p electron. If enough energy is supplied, an electron will 
be ripped off, and the electron will flow freely through the material. If 
some energy is supplied but not enough to rip off the electron, the electron 
can get excited to a higher energy level. The energy required to excite an 
electron is given by the vertical distance in the figure from an occupied to 
an unoccupied energy level. In either case, we say that an electron-hole pair 
forms. If the amount of energy supplied is too small to excite an electron 
from a filled to unfilled state, the external energy will not be absorbed. 

Energy Levels of Electrons of Isolated Al and Isolated P Atoms at T> 
0 
K 

How do the energy levels change when the Al and P atoms are at temperatures 
above absolute zero, where electrons are continuously vibrating 
and moving? First, the energy levels broaden. The electrons can still only 
take certain energy levels, but there is a wider range to the allowed energy 
levels. Second, occasionally, electrons spontaneously get excited into 
higher states. For example, a 3p electron may get excited into the 4s state 
temporarily. If it does, it will quickly return to the ground state. 

Energy Levels of AlP at T 
=0 
K 

How much energy does it take to rip an electron off an AlP crystal at 
T 
=0 
K? The three valence electrons of each Al atom and the five valence 
electrons of each P atom form chemical bonds. The energy required to rip 
off these electrons is slightly different than the energy required to rip off 
the equivalent electrons of isolated Al and isolated P atoms. Figure 6.4 
illustrates the energy levels of the valence electrons of AlP. Unlike in the 
previous figures, these energy levels do not come from actual data. Instead, 
they are meant as a rough illustration of the effect. The amount of energy

Valence BandConduction BandEnergy gap
Figure 6.5: Energy level diagram of a semiconductor zoomed in to show 
only the conduction and valence band. 

required to rip off an electron is represented on the energy level diagram 
by the vertical distance from that level to the ground level at the top of 
the diagram. The energies needed to remove inner shell electrons do not 
significantly change from the energy levels of isolated atoms. 

Energy levels due to electrons shared amongst atoms in a solid semiconductor 
are called energy bands. The filled energy level closest to the 
top of an energy level diagram for a semiconductor is called the valence 
band. The energy level above it is called the conduction band. The energy 
gap Eg, also called the bandgap, is the energy difference from the top of 
the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band. The term valence 
electron refers to an outer shell electron while the term valence band refers 
to a possible energy level it may occupy. At T 
=0 
K, the valence band is 
typically filled, and the conduction band may be empty or partially empty. 
We often are only interested in the valence and conduction bands because 
we are interested in energy conversion processes involving small amounts 
of energy. For this reason, we often plot energy level diagrams zoomed in 
vertically to just show these two energy levels as shown in Fig. 6.5. 

If the AlP crystal has defects or impurities, the energy levels broaden 
a bit because the electrical potential (in volts) seen by each Al and each P 
atom is slightly different from the potential seen by other Al and P atoms 
in the crystal. Thus, it takes slightly different amounts of energy to rip off 
each electron. For this reason, energy levels in amorphous materials are 
quite a bit broader than energy levels in crystals of the same composition 
[10]. If the AlP crystal has defects or impurities, additional allowed energy 
levels may be present. Some of these energy levels may even fall within the 
energy gap. 

Energy Levels of AlP at T>

As with isolated atoms, there are two differences between energy levels for 
crystals such as AlP at T> 
0 
K compared to at T 
=0 
K. First, energy 

 
114 6.3 Semiconductors and Energy Level Diagrams 

levels broaden. Second, some electrons get excited to higher energy levels 
and quickly, perhaps in a few microseconds, decay back down. 

6.3.3 Definitions of Conductors, Dielectrics, and Semiconductors 
Conductors, dielectrics, and semiconductors were defined in section 1.5.1. 
Now that we have seen example energy level diagrams, we should revisit 
these definitions as well as define the term semimetal. In the presence of an 
applied external voltage, electric field, optical field, or other energy source, 
valence electrons flow easily in a conductor [10, p. 429] [11, ch. 4]. In a 
conductor, the conduction band is partially filled with electrons, so there 
are many available energy states for electrons remaining in the conduction 
band. With just a little bit of external energy, possibly even from vibrations 
that naturally occur at T> 
0 
K, valence electrons flow easily. Inner shell 
electrons can be ripped off their atoms and flow, but significantly more 
energy is needed to rip off inner shell than valence electrons. 

In the presence of an applied external voltage, electric field, optical field, 
or other energy source, electrons do not flow easily in an insulator [10, p. 

429] [11, ch. 4]. The valence band is filled and the conduction band is 
empty. The energy gap between valence band and conduction band in an 
insulator is typically above 3 eV. A little heat or energy from vibrations is 
not enough to excite an electron from one allowed energy state to another. 
If a large enough external source of energy is applied, though, an electron 
can be excited or ripped off of an insulator. 
In Sec. 3.3, electro-optic materials were discussed. Some insulators 
are electro-optic which means that in the presence of an external electric 
or optical field, the spatial distribution of electrons changes slightly which 
cause a material polarization to build up. Photons of the external electric 
or optical field in this case do not have enough energy to excite electrons 
in the insulator, so the internal momentum of electrons in the material 
does not change. The electro-optic effect occurs in insulators and involves 
external energies too small to excite electrons from one allowed energy state 
to another while the affects discussed in Sec. 6.3 involve semiconductors 
and external energies large enough to excite electrons from one energy level 
to another. 

At T 
=0 
K in a semiconductor, the valence band is full, and the 
conduction band is empty. The energy gap of a semiconductor is small, in 
the range 0:5 
eV . 
Eg 
. 
3 
eV. In the presence of a small applied voltage, 
electric field, or optical field, a semiconductor acts as an insulator. In the 
presence of a large applied voltage or other energy source, a semiconductor 

 
6 PHOTOVOLTAICS 115 

acts as a conductor, and electrons flow. Photodiodes and solar cells are 
made from semiconductors. If enough energy is supplied to a photodiode, 
for example from an optical beam, the valence electrons will flow. More 
specifically, the photons of the external optical beam must have more energy 
than the energy gap of the semiconductor for the valence electrons to flow. 

The term semimetal is used to describe conductors with low electron 
concentration. Similar to conductors, in a semimetal at T 
=0 
K, there 
is no energy gap because the conduction band is partially filled with electrons, 
and there are plenty of available energy states. The concentration of 

electrons

electrons for semimetals, however, is in the range n< 
1022 
cm3 
while 
n 
is greater for conductors [26, p. 304]. 

6.3.4 Why Are Solar Cells and Photodetectors Made from Semiconductors? 
Energy level diagrams for AlP were illustrated above. The energy gap of 
AlP is Eg 
=2:45 
eV, so it is a semiconductor [9] [10, p. 432,543]. If a beam 
of light with photons of energy E< 
2:45 
eV is applied to a piece of AlP, the 
photons will not be absorbed, and no electrons will be excited. If a beam 
of light with photons of energy E 
≥ 
2:45 
eV is applied to a piece of AlP, 
some of those photons may be absorbed. When a photon is absorbed, an 
electron will be excited from the valence band to the conduction band. A 
blue photon with energy E 
=3:1 
eV will be absorbed by AlP, for example, 
but a red photon with energy E 
=1:9 
eV will not. When the electron is 
excited, the internal momentum of the electron necessarily changes. The 
excited electron quickly spontaneously decays back to its lowest energy 
state, and it may emit a photon or a phonon in the process. If a beam 
of light with photons of significantly higher energy is applied to a piece of 
AlP, it is possible to rip off electrons entirely from their atom. 

Why are solar cells and optical photodetectors made from semiconductors 
instead of insulators? Sunlight is composed of light at multiple 
wavelengths, and it is most intense at wavelengths that correspond to yellow 
and green light. Green photons have energies near E 
≈ 
2:2 
eV, and 
visible photons have energies in the range 1:9 
eV <E< 
3:1 
eV. 
Solar 
cells are made from materials with an energy gap less than the energy of 
most of the photons from sunlight. Semiconductors are used because the 
energy of each photon is large enough to excite the electrons in the material. 
Insulators are not used because most of the photons of visible light do 
not have enough energy to excite electrons in the material. The material 
should not have an energy gap that is too large otherwise photons will not 
be absorbed.

Why are solar cells and optical photodetectors made from semiconductors 
instead of conductors? When light shines on a solar cell or photodetector, 
photons of light are absorbed by the material. If the photon absorbed 
has energy greater than the energy gap of the material, the electron quickly 
decays to the top of the conduction band. With some more time, it decays 
back to the lowest energy state. In a solar cell or photodetector, a pn 
junction is used to cause the electrons to flow before decaying back to the 
ground state. The amount of energy converted to electricity per excited 
electron depends on the energy gap of the material, not the energy of the 
incoming photon. Only energy Eg 
per photon absorbed is converted to 
electricity regardless of the original energy of the photon. Thus, the energy 
gap of the material used to make a solar cell or photodetector should be 
large so that as much energy per excited electron is converted to electricity 
as possible. The material should not have an energy gap that is too small 
otherwise very little of the energy will be converted to electricity. The electron 
and hole will release the excess energy, hf 
 
Eg, quickly in the form 
of heat or lattice vibrations called phonons. 

Each semiconductor has a different energy gap Eg. Many solar cells and 
photodetectors are made from silicon, which is a semiconductor with Eg 
= 


1:1 
eV. Predicting the energy gap of a material is quite difficult. However, 
all else equal, if an element of a semiconductor is replaced with one below 
it in the periodic table, the energy gap tends to get smaller. This trend is 
illustrated in Table 6.1. Data for the table comes from [9]. This trend is 
also illustrated in Fig. 6.6, which plots the energy gap and lattice constant 
for various semiconductors. Figure 6.6 is taken from reference [71]. The 
horizontal axis represents the interatomic spacing in units of angstroms, 
where one angstrom equals 1010 
meters. The vertical axis represents the 
energy gap in eV. This figure illustrates energy gaps and lattice constants 
for materials of a wide range of compositions. For example, the energy 
gap for aluminum phosphide can be found from the point labeled AlP, and 
the energy gap of aluminum arsenide can be found from the point labeled 
AlAs. Energy gap for semiconductors of composition AlAsxP1x 
can be 
found from the line between these points.

Some solar cells are made from layered material with the largest energy 
gap material on the top. For example, a solar cell could be made from a top 
layer of ZnS, a middle layer of ZnSe, and a bottom layer of ZnTe. Photons 
with energy E> 
3:6 
eV would be absorbed in the ZnS layer. Photons 
with energy 2:7 
eV<E<3.6 eV would be absorbed by the ZnSe layer, and 
photons with energy 2.25 eV<E<2.7 eV would be absorbed by the ZnTe 
layer. Each photon of energy absorbed by the ZnS layer and converted 
to electricity would have more energy than each photon absorbed by the 
ZnSe layer. Solar cells made from layers in this way can be more efficient at 
converting energy from optical energy to electricity than equivalent solar 
cells made of a single material.

6.3.5 Electron Energy Distribution 
The Fermi energy level of a semiconductor, denoted Ef 
, represents the 
energy level at which the probability of finding an electron is one half [9] 
[10, p. 432,543]. The Fermi level depends on temperature, and it depends 
on the impurities in the semiconductor. Chemists sometime call the Fermi

In a pure semiconductor at T 
=0 
K, all electrons occupy the lowest 
possible states. The valence band is completely filled, and the conduction 
band is completely empty. The Fermi level, Ef 
, is the energy level at the 
middle of the energy gap. No electrons are found at energy Ef 
because no 
electrons can have an energy inside the energy gap. However, the Fermi 
level is a useful measure to describe the material. 

In a pure semiconductor at T> 
0 
K, some electrons are excited into 
higher energy levels. As the temperature increases, more electrons are likely 
to be found at higher energy levels more often. The probability that an 

E=kB

electron is in energy level E 
varies with temperature as e

The concentration and type of impurities influence the energy of the 
Fermi level. A p-type material has a lack of electrons. For this reason in 
a p-type material, Ef 
is closer to the valence band than the middle of the 
energy gap. An n-type material has an excess of electrons. For this reason 
in a n-type material, Ef 
is closer to the conduction band. 

6.4 Crystallography Revisited 
6.4.1 Real Space and Reciprocal Space 
Physicists and chemists are often interested in where electrons or nucleons 
of atoms are likely to be found with respect to position in real space. Ideas 
of a lattice, basis, and crystal structure were discussed in Sec. 2.3.2. To 
review, a lattice describes the arrangements of points. The basis describes 
how atoms are arranged at each lattice point. The lattice and basis together 
form the crystal structure. A 3D lattice is described by three lattice vectors 

 
!

! 


a1, a2 
, and  
a3. If they are chosen as short as possible, they are called 
primitive lattice vectors. The magnitude of a primitive lattice vector may 
be around 0:1 
nm. The primitive lattice vectors define a cell called a 
primitive cell. Since a lattice is periodic, if we know how to describe one 
primitive cell, we can describe the entire lattice. 

For each lattice, there is a corresponding reciprocal lattice defined by 
a set of vectors. Both contain the same information in different forms.

120 6.4 Crystallography Revisited 

Lattice vectors in real space have units of length, m. Lattice vectors in 
reciprocal space have units m1 
. 

The reciprocal lattice gives information about the spatial frequency of 
atoms. If the planes of atoms in a crystal are closely spaced in one direction,

 
! 


ja1| 
is relatively small. The corresponding reciprocal vector jb1 
| 
is relatively 
large. The reciprocal lattice represents the spatial frequency of the atom 

 


in units m1 
. If the planes of atoms in a crystal are far apart, ja1| 
is large 



 


and jb1 
| 
is small. 

If a beam of light shines on a crystal where the wavelength of light 
is close to the crystal spacing, light will be diffracted, and the diffraction 
pattern is related to the reciprocal lattice. The Brillouin zone is a primitive 
cell for a reciprocal lattice. The volume of a unit cell in reciprocal space 
over a unit cell in real space is given by

6.4.2 E versus k Diagrams 
The energy level diagrams, discussed in Section 6.3, plot allowed energies 
of electrons where the vertical axis represented energy. No variation is 
shown on the horizontal axis. The most useful energy level diagrams for 
semiconductors are zoomed in so that only the valence and conduction 
band are shown. In many cases, it is useful to plot energy level diagrams 
versus position in real space. For such a diagram the vertical axis represents 
energy, and the horizontal axis represents position. It is also useful to plot 
energy level diagrams versus position in reciprocal space.

Indirect SemiconductorE|!k|
Figure 6.9: Two possible mechanisms of photon absorption in an indirect 
gap semiconductor. 

What happens when we shine light on a direct semiconductor? A photon 
of sufficient energy can excite an electron from the valence band to the 
conduction band to create an electron-hole pair. What happens in an indirect 
semiconductor? Figure 6.9 illustrates two possibilities. As illustrated 
by the longer arrow, an electron can be excited directly from the valence to 
conduction band. However, this requires a photon of more energy than the 
vertical distance between the top of the valence band and the bottom of 
the conduction band [25, p. 200]. Alternatively, as illustrated by the other 
two arrows, excitation from the top of the valence band to the bottom of 
the conduction band may involve a photon and a phonon. Both energy and 
momentum must be conserved, so a change in crystal momentum is needed 
to excite an electron in this case. Solar cells and photodetectors may be 
made from either direct or indirect semiconductors. 

6.5 Pn Junctions 
Many devices, including photovoltaic devices, LEDs, photodiodes, semiconductor 
lasers, and thermoelectric devices are essentially made from pn 
junctions. To understand photovoltaic devices and these other energy conversion 
devices, we need to understand pn junctions. Consider a semiconductor 
crystal composed of an n-type material (with excess electrons) on 
one side and a p-type material (lacking electrons, in other words, with an 
excess of holes) on the other side. The junction of the p-type and n-type 
materials is called a pn junction. Assume the junction is abrupt and is at 
thermal equilibrium. 

Some pn junctions are made from elemental semiconductors like Si, and 
other pn junctions are made from compound semiconductors like GaAs. 

 
6 PHOTOVOLTAICS 123 

p-typen-typeValence bandConduction bandFermi levelEnergyposition
Figure 6.10: Energy level diagram of p-type and n-type semiconductors. 

Some pn junctions have the same material on both sides while other pn 
junctions have different materials on either side. For example, a pn junction 
can be made from an n-type layer of GaAs and a p-type layer of GaAs. It 
can also be made from an n-type layer of GaAs and a p-type layer of AlAs. 

What happens when we put a p-type material and an n-type material 
together to form a pn junction? Valence electrons and holes move. Nuclei 
and inner shell electrons do not. Some excess electrons from the n-type 
region go towards the p-type region. Some excess holes from the p-type 
region go towards the n-type region. These charge carriers diffuse, are 
swept away from, a region near the junction. This region near the junction 
which is lacking charge carriers is called the depletion layer [10, p. 564]. 
As shown in Fig. 6.10, the Fermi level Ef 
is near the valence band for 
p-type materials. P-type material lacks electrons, so the energy where it is 
equally likely to find an electron state occupied and unoccupied is closer 
to the valence band. For a similar reason, the Fermi level Ef 
is near the 
conduction band for n-type materials. Figure 6.11 shows the energy level 
diagram versus position for the pn junction, and Fermi levels of the two 
materials are lined up in this figure. 

Consider a junction where the n-type material is silicon doped with 
phosphorous atoms and the p-type material is silicon doped with aluminum 
atoms. The n-type side of the pn junction has an excess of positive charges 
because some phosphorous atoms replace Si atoms in the material. Phosphorous 
atoms have one more proton than silicon atoms. They also have 
one more electron, but the valence electron is a charge carrier which diffuses 
away from the junction. Similarly, the p-type side of the junction has 

 
124 6.5 Pn Junctions 

an excess of negative charges because some aluminum atoms replace silicon 
atoms. Aluminum atoms have one less proton than Si atoms. They also 
have one less electron, but the hole is a charge carrier which also diffuses 
away from the junction. 

An electric field forms across the junction due to the net charge distribution 
near the junction. Electric field intensity is the force per unit 
charge, and it has the units mV. There is also necessarily a voltage drop 
across a pn junction in equilibrium, and this voltage is called the contact 
potential V0 
in the units of volts. While the contact potential is a voltage, 
it cannot be measured by placing a voltmeter across a pn junction because 
additional junctions would be formed at each lead of the voltmeter with 
additional voltages introduced [9, p. 141]. 

Figure 6.11 illustrates the energy level diagram of a pn junction. The 
horizontal axis represents position, and the vertical axis represents energy. 
It is related to the figures in Section 6.3. However, Fig. 6.11 is zoomed in 
vertically, and it is plotted versus position near the junction. It also shows 
the relationship between the energy level diagram and the circuit symbol 
for a diode, and the depletion layer is labeled. The vertical distance qV0 
, 
also labeled in Fig. 6.11, represents the amount of energy required to move 
an electron across the junction [9, p. 141]. 

Figure 6.12 shows the energy level diagram for a forward biased pn 
junction. In a forward biased pn junction, current flows from the p-type to 
n-type side of the junction. More specifically, holes flow from the p-type 
to n-type region, and some of these holes neutralize excess charges in the 
depletion layer. The depletion layer becomes narrower. The electric field 
preventing the flow of charges gets smaller, and the voltage drop across the 
junction gets smaller. The energy q 
(V0 
 
Vx) 
is labeled in Fig. 6.12 for a 
forward biased pn junction where the voltage Vx 
is the voltage supplied. 
This energy represents the energy needed to get charges to flow across the 
junction, and it is smaller than the corresponding energy in the case of the 
unbiased junction. Charges flow more easily in the case of a forward biased 
pn junction, and the diode acts as a wire. 

Figure 6.13 shows the energy level diagram for a reversed biased pn 
junction. For a reverse biased pn junction, the voltage across the junction 
V0 
+ 
Vx 
is larger than for an unbiased junction, and the energy needed for 
charges to flow q 
(V0 
+ 
Vx) 
is larger than for an unbiased junction. Reversed 
biased pn junctions act as open circuits, and charges do not flow due to 
this amount of energy required. 

A light emitting diode (LED) is a device that converts electricity to 
optical electromagnetic energy, and it is made from a semiconductor pn 
junction. In use, a forward bias is put across the LED as shown in Fig.

6.12. Holes flow from the p-type to n-type region. Some of these holes 
combine with electrons in the depletion layer. In an LED, photons are 
emitted in this process. The energy of the emitted photon corresponds to 
the energy of the energy gap. Some LEDs have an additional intrinsic, 
undoped, layer at the junction, between the p-type and n-type layers to 
improve the efficiency of the device. 
A solar cell and an optical photodetector are also essentially pn junctions. 
Both of these devices convert optical electromagnetic energy to electricity. 
When light shines on these devices, electron-hole pairs are created 
at the junction. Due to the charge distribution across the junction, many 
of the electrons and holes created are swept away from the junction before 
they can recombine [9]. This flow of charges is a current, so the optical 
electromagnetic energy is converted into electricity. When light shines on 
a photovoltaic device, a voltage can be measured across the junction, and 
this effect is called the photovoltaic effect [9, p. 212]. 

The vertical distance between the conduction band and the valence 
band on an energy level diagram is the energy gap Eg. The energy gap 
of the material used to make a solar cell or photodetector determines the 
properties of the device. Photons with energy greater than the energy gap 
have enough energy to form electron-hole pairs while photons with less

energy cannot. 

If a temperature gradient is applied across a pn junction, charges flow. 
When one side of the device is heated, charges move more rapidly and these 
energetic charges diffuse to the cooler side. This effect, called the Seebeck 
thermoelectric effect, is discussed in Chapter 8. 

6.6 Solar Cells 
6.6.1 Solar Cell Efficiency 
Energy conversion devices are never 100% efficient. Efficiency is defined as 
the output power over the input power. Efficiency of a solar cell is often 
defined as the ratio of electrical power out to optical power in to the device.

Not all sunlight reaches a solar cell because some of it is absorbed by 
the earth's atmosphere. This atmospheric absorption is strongly dependent 
on wavelength. Figure 6.14 is a plot of the transmissivity of the 
atmosphere as a function of wavelength. It plots the percent of light which 
passes through the atmosphere without getting absorbed. Some gases in 
the atmosphere, such as water vapor and CO2, absorb a significant amount 
of energy at particular wavelengths. The figure indicates which gas is responsible 
for atmospheric absorption at some particular wavelengths. For 
example, ozone O3 
absorbs ultraviolet light. Ozone in the atmosphere offers 
benefits because ultraviolet light can damage eyes and skin. The intensity 
of the optical power from the sun that is hits a solar cell varies from day 

 
128 6.6 Solar Cells 

to day and location to location. In a bright sunny area, a solar cell may 
W

receive around 0.1 cm2 
[73, p. 7]. 

Even if energy from the sunlight reaches a solar cell, the energy is not 
converted to electricity with perfect efficiency. There are multiple reasons 
for this inefficiency, and some of these reasons relate to the fact that not 
all light that hits a solar cell is absorbed. Light may heat up the solar 
cell instead of exciting electrons to create electron-hole pairs [74]. Alternatively, 
light may be reflected off the solar cell surface [74]. Many solar 
cells have an antireflection coating to reduce reflections, but they are not 
eliminated. The surface of other solar cells are manufactured to be rough 
instead of smooth to reduce reflections. Furthermore, if a photon hits an 
electron that is already excited, the photon will not be absorbed. Additionally, 
solar cells have wires throughout the surface to capture the produced 
electricity. These wires are often thin and in a finger-like configuration. 
Light that hits these wires does not reach the semiconductor portion of 
the solar cell and is not efficiently converted to electricity. To reduce this 
issue, wires of some solar cells are made from materials that are partially 
transparent conductors, such as indium tin oxide or tin oxide SnO2 
[74]. Indium 
tin oxide is a transparent conductor with a moderately high electrical 
conductivity of σ 
= 
106

· 
1 
m [75]. 

Other reasons that solar cells are not perfectly efficient have to do with 
what happens after a photon excites an electron. An electron may be 
excited, but it may decay before it gets swept from the junction [74]. A 
photon may excite an electron to a level above the conduction band, but the 
electron may quickly decay to the top of the conduction band losing some 
energy to heat. Internal resistance in the bulk n-type or p-type regions 
may convert electricity to heat. There may also be internal resistance of 
wiring in the system. Also unmatched loads make solar cells less efficient 
than matched loads [74]. 

The voltage across and the current produced by an illuminated solar 
cell are both functions of temperature. Reference [76] demonstrates, both 
theoretically and experimentally, that efficiency of a solar cell decreases 
as temperature increases. A number of mechanisms occurring in a solar 
cell are dependent on temperature. First, as the temperature increases, 
the allowed energy levels broaden. For this reason, the energy gap Eg, 
which is proportional to the voltage produced by the solar cell, is smaller 
at higher temperatures. As temperature increases, this voltage produced 
by the solar cell decreases roughly linearly [76]. Second, the current due 
to recombination of electron-hole pairs at the junction is a function of 
temperature. At higher temperatures, more electron-hole pairs recombine 
at the junction, so the overall current produced by the solar cell is less. For 

 
6 PHOTOVOLTAICS 129 

this reason, as temperature increases, the overall current produced by the 
solar cell decreases roughly exponentially [76]. This effect on the current is 
the main reason that solar cell efficiency depends on temperature. Other 
mechanisms are temperature dependent, but are less significant [76]. 

6.6.2 Solar Cell Technologies 
There are four major solar cell technologies being developed: crystalline, 
thin film, multijunction cells, and emerging photovoltaic technologies [77]. 
However, these categories are not distinct because some solar cells fit into 
multiple categories simultaneously. Figure 6.15, from [77], compares solar 
cells of these technologies. More specifically, it shows record efficiencies 
for each of these types of solar cells as well as the year the records were 
achieved. 

The first category is crystalline, and these cells may be made from single 
crystals or from polycrystalline material [78]. The first generation of 
solar cells was made with this technology. For a simple recipe for how to 
produce a crystalline solar cell, see [69]. Most solar cells produced today, 
around 80% of the market, are silicon cells in this category. Typical efficiency 
of a crystalline solar cell available today may be around 20% [78]. 
Polycrystalline solar cells are often cheaper and a bit less efficient than 
single crystalline cells. 

The second category is thin film. To make these solar cells, thin films 
of semiconductors are deposited on a substrate such as glass or steel. The 
substrate may be rigid or flexible. The solar cell itself may be made of 
layers of material only a few microns thick. Thin film solar cells may be 
cheaper than other types of solar cells [78]. Often they are less efficient 
than crystalline cells, but they have other advantages [78]. One material 
used to make thin film solar cells is amorphous silicon. Another material 
in use is CdTe, which has a energy gap 1.45 eV. Cadmium and tellurium 
are both toxic, but they may be easier to deposit in thin films than silicon. 

The third category is multijunction, also called compound, solar cells. 
These solar cells are made of a dozen or more layers of semiconductor 
stacked on top of each other [78]. These layers form multiple pn junctions. 
Larger gap semiconductors are on the upper layers, and smaller gap 
semiconductors are closer to the substrate. These solar cells can be quite 
efficient. Cells with efficiency up to 46% have been demonstrated in labs 
[77]. 

The last category is emerging technology solar cells. Multiple creative 
strategies are being used to develop solar cells. Nanotechnology strategies 
include using solar cells made from carbon nanotubes and from quantum 

 
130 6.6 Solar Cells 

dot based materials [78]. Organic solar cells also fall into this category. 
The active part of these solar cells is a thin, often 100-200 nm, layer of 
an organic material [79]. One advantage of organic solar cells is that their 
processing may not require as high of temperatures as the processing of 
solar cells made from pn junctions of inorganic semiconductors [79]. 

6.6.3 Solar Cell Systems 
Solar cells are used in a wide range of devices. Inexpensive lawn ornaments 
with solar cells are available at hardware stores for less than a dollar. Small 
photovoltaic devices used as optical sensors are equally inexpensive. On 
the other extreme, solar cells power the NASA Mars rovers Spirit and 
Opportunity as well as satellites orbiting the earth. Also, large arrays of 
solar cells are used to generate electricity. 

A typical solar cell produces around a watt of electrical power while 
a typical house may require around 4 kW of power [73]. To produce the 
necessary power, individual solar cells are connected together into modules, 
and the modules are connected together into solar panels. In a typical installation 
on the roof of a house, a panel may be composed of around 40 
solar cells, and 10 or 20 panels may be mounted roof [73]. A typical solar 
panel installation on the roof of a building has a number of components 
in addition to the solar panel arrays. The additional components are often 
referred to as the balance of the system, and they consist of batteries, 
mounting or tracking hardware, solar concentrators, and power conditioners. 
These components are illustrated in Fig. 6.16. 

The mounting system is composed of the foundation, mechanical supports, 
brackets, and wiring needed to physically mount and connect the 
solar panel. Some solar panels are mounted in a fixed position. Other 
solar panels are mounted on systems that angle the panels towards the 
sun. Some tracking systems rotate the panel around a single east-west 
axis. Others have two axes. Two axis tracking systems are often used with 
solar concentrators. A concentrator is a mirror or lens system designed to 
capture more of the sun's light onto the panels. 

Solar panel systems require batteries or some other energy storage mechanism 
to provide electrical power at night, on cloudy days, and other times 
when inadequate sunlight falls on the solar panels. Solar panels can last 
30 years or more with only about 1% or 2% degradation per year. Also, 
solar panels rarely need maintenance, and they cannot easily be repaired. 
If a solar panel fails, the entire panel is replaced. However, batteries have 
a typical lifetime of three to nine years, and they are often the first part of 
a solar panel system that needs replacement [73].

The power conditioning system consists of an inverter which converts 
DC electricity to AC and, for grid tied systems, a system to match the phase 
of the produced AC power to the phase of the grid. Power conditioning 
systems also contain a system to limit the current or voltage to maximize 
the power delivered. Also, they include safeguards such as fuses to prevent 
injury or damage to equipment. The typical lifetime for the electronics 
may be around 10-15 years [73]. 

6.7 Photodetectors 
6.7.1 Types of Photodetectors 
Photodetectors are sensors used to convert light, at optical or other nearby 
frequencies, to electricity. One way to classify photodetectors is by their 
type of active material, which may be a solid or a gas. The first type of 
detectors are semiconductor photodetectors made from solid semiconductor 
pn junctions. The choice of semiconductor influences the wavelengths 
of light which can be absorbed because only photons with energy greater 
than or equal to the energy gap of the semiconductor can be absorbed. For 
example, silicon has an energy gap of 1.11 eV, so it is able to absorb the 
photons in both the visible range 1:9 
eV <E< 
3:1 
eV as well as photons in 
the near infrared range 1:1 
eV <E< 
1:9 
eV. In some semiconductor photodetectors, 
a thin intrinsic (undoped) layer is added between the p-type 
material and the n-type material at the junction. In these semiconductor 
p-i-n junction photodetectors, the added layer widens the depletion layer. 
It also decreases the internal capacitance of the junction thereby increasing 
the detector response time [10, p. 660]. The second type of detectors are 

 
6 PHOTOVOLTAICS 133 

made from gas filled vacuum tubes, and these detectors are called phototubes 
[10, p. 646]. A voltage is placed across electrodes in the tubes. 
When light shines on the phototube, energy from a photon of light can rip 
off an electron from a gas atom. The electron and ion flow towards the 
electrodes, thereby producing electricity. The most common type of phototube 
is the photomultiplier tube. This device has multiple electrodes, and 
when an electron hits one of these electrodes, additional electrons are emitted. 
These electrons can hit additional electrodes to produce even more 
electrons. Because each incoming photon produces a cascade of electrons, 
photomultiplier tubes have high internal amplification. 

Another way to classify photodetectors depends on whether incoming 
photons have enough energy to rip off electrons or just excite them. The 
first type of detectors are called photoelectric detectors, and they operate 
based on a process called photoelectric emission [10, p. 645] [27, p. 171]. 
In these detectors, incoming light has energy greater than or equal to the 
energy from the valence band to the ground level at the top of an energy 
level diagram. These detectors convert light to electricity because incoming 
photons of light rip electrons off their atoms, and the flow of the resulting 
electrons is a current. The second type of detectors are called photoconductive 
detectors or sometimes photovoltaic detectors, and they operate based 
on a process called photoconductivity [10, p. 647]. In these detectors, incoming 
light has energy equal to the difference between the valence and 
conduction bands, not enough to rip off electrons. These detectors convert 
light to electricity because incoming photons excite electrons, and the 
conductivity of the detector is higher when light shines on it. Solid semiconductor 
photodetectors can operate based on either photoelectric emission 
or photoconductivity, but most operate based on photoconductivity. 
Phototubes typically operate based on photoelectric emission. 

Some photodetectors have a single element while others are made from 
an array of elements. A digital camera may contain millions of individual 
photodetectors. These elements are integrated with a charge-coupled device 
(CCD), which is circuitry to sequentially transfer the electrical output of 
each photodetector of the array [9, p. 359]. The CCD was invented in 1969 
by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith. For this invention, they shared 
the 2009 Physics Nobel Prize with Charles K. Kao, who was awarded the 
prize for his work on optical fibers [80]. 

Eyes in animals are photodetectors. The retina of the human eye is an 
array composed of around 120 million rod cells and 6 to 7 million cone cells 
[81]. These cells convert light to electrical impulses which are sent to the 
brain. 

 
134 6.7 Photodetectors 

6.7.2 Measures of Photodetectors 
The frequency response is one of the most important measures of a photodetector. 
Often it is plotted versus wavelength or photon energy instead of 
frequency. A photodetector is only sensitive within a particular wavelength 
range, and the frequency response is often not flat. 

As with all types of sensors, signal to noise ratio is another important 
measure. While photodetectors have many sources of noise, one major 
source is thermal noise due to the random motion of charges as they flow 
through a solid [9, p. 220]. To mitigate thermal noise in photodetectors 
used to detect very weak signals, the detectors are cooled with thermoelectric 
devices or using liquid nitrogen. A measure related to signal to noise 
ratio is the noise equivalent power. It is defined as the optical power in 
watts that produces a signal to noise ratio of one [82]. 

Another measure of a photodetector is the detectivity, denoted D*, in 
cm(Hz1=2)

units . It is a measure of the strength of the output assuming a

W 

one watt optical input. By definition, it is equal to the square root of the 
area of the sensor times the bandwidth under consideration divided by the 
noise equivalent power [82] [83, p. 654].

Figure 6.17 shows detectivity versus wavelength for optical detectors made 
of various semiconductors. 
Photodetectors are also characterized by their response times. Response 
time is defined as the time needed for a photodetector to respond to a step-
like optical input [82]. Typical response times can range from picoseconds 
to milliseconds [83, p. 656]. There may be a tradeoff between response 
time and sensitivity, so some detectors are designed for fast operation while 
others are design for higher sensitivity [9, p. 220].

LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 

7 Lamps, LEDs, and Lasers 

7.1 Introduction 
Chapter 6 discussed devices that convert light to electricity. In this chapter, 
we discuss devices that convert electricity to light. These devices vary 
widely in size and shape from tiny Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and 
semiconductor lasers to large high power gas lasers. In addition to LEDs 
and lasers, lamps and optical amplifiers are also discussed. 

We take lamps for granted now because they are present in practically 
all buildings. However, their invention dramatically improved human productivity 
because lamps allowed people to constructively use indoor spaces 
at night. Similarly, lasers have improved productivity in many activities. 
We encounter them almost daily in our use of communications networks, 
DVD players, medical devices, and in other applications. 

7.2 Absorption, Spontaneous Emission, Stimulated Emission 
Absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission are three related 
energy conversion processes. Chapter 6 discussed devices based on 
absorption including solar cells and photodetectors. Devices which operate 
based on spontaneous emission include LEDs and lamps. Optical amplifiers 
and lasers operate based on stimulated emission. 

7.2.1 Absorption 
Absorption is the process in which optical energy is converted to internal 
energy of electrons, atoms, or molecules. When a photon is absorbed, the 
energy may cause an electron in an atom to go from a lower to a higher 
energy level, thereby changing the internal momentum of the electron and 
the electron's internal quantum numbers. This process was illustrated in 
Chapter 6 by energy level diagrams. Energy in a solar cell or photodetector 
is then converted to electricity because the excited charge carriers can travel 
more freely through the material. The electrons absorbing the energy may 
be part of atoms which make up solids, liquids, gases, or plasmas. They 
may be around isolated neutral atoms, ionic compounds, or complicated 
organic molecules. Furthermore the electrons absorbing the energy may be 
part of conductive, insulating, or semiconducting materials. The photons 
absorbed may be optical photons, with individual energies in the range 1.9 
to 3.1 eV that can be detected by human eyes. Alternatively, they may have 

 
140 7.2 Absorption, Spontaneous Emission, Stimulated Emission 

energies that are multiple orders of magnitude larger or smaller than the 
energy of a visible photon. For example, in isolated neutral neon atoms in 
the ground state, electrons occupy the 2p energy level but not the 3s energy 
level. These energy levels are separated by an energy gap of Eg 
=1:96 
eV 
which corresponds with energy of red photons of wavelength 632.8 nm [31]. 
If a photon of this energy impinges upon neon gas, the photon may be 
absorbed, and an electron of a neon atom would be excited to the higher 
energy level. Photons of smaller energy would not be absorbed. Photons 
of larger energy may be absorbed depending on allowed energy levels. As 
another example, the energy gap of the semiconductor gallium phosphide, 
GaP, is 2.2 eV which corresponds with the energy of a green photon of 
wavelength 549 nm. If a photon of this energy impinges on a piece of 
gallium phosphide, it may be absorbed. 

7.2.2 Spontaneous Emission 
Spontaneous emission is an energy conversion process in which an excited 
electron or molecule decays to an available lower energy level and in the process 
gives off a photon. This process occurs naturally and does not involve 
interaction of other photons. The average time for decay by spontaneous 
emission is called the spontaneous emission lifetime. For some excited energy 
levels this spontaneous decay occurs on average within nanoseconds 
while in other materials it occurs within a few seconds [10, p. 480]. As 
with absorption, this process can occur in isolated atoms, ionic compounds, 
molecules, and other types of materials, and it can occur in solids, liquids, 
and gases. Energy is conserved when the electron decays to the lower level, 
and that energy must go somewhere. The energy may be converted to 
heat, mechanical vibrations, or electromagnetic photons. If it is converted 
to photons, the process is called spontaneous emission, and the energy of 
the photon produced is equal to the energy difference between the electron 
energy levels involved. The emitted photon may have any direction, phase, 
and electromagnetic polarization. 

There are many ways in which an electron can be excited to a higher 
energy level [10, p. 455]. Spontaneous emission processes may be classified 
based on the source of energy which excites the electrons, and these classes 
are listed in Table 7.1. If the initial source of energy for spontaneous emission 
is supplied optically, the process is called photoluminescence. Glow in 
the dark materials emit light by this process. If the initial form of energy 
is supplied by a chemical reaction, the process is called chemiluminescence. 
Glow sticks produce spontaneous emission by chemiluminescence. If the 
initial form of energy is supplied by a voltage, the process is called electro

luminescence. LEDs emit light by electroluminescence. If the initial form 
of energy is caused by sound waves, the process is called sonoluminescence. 
If the initial form of energy is due to accelerated electrons hitting a target, 
this process is called cathodoluminescence. If spontaneous emission occurs 
in a living organism, such a firefly, the process is called bioluminescence. 

At temperatures above absolute zero, some electrons in atoms are thermally 
excited to energy levels above the ground state. These electrons decay 
and emit a photon by spontaneous emission. Any object at a temperature 
above absolute zero naturally emits photons by spontaneous emission, and 
this process is called blackbody radiation. In 1900, Max Planck derived a 
formula for the energy density per unit bandwidth of a blackbody radiator 
by making the assumption that only discrete energies are allowed [10, p. 
453]. His work agreed with known experimental data, and it is one of the 
fundamental ideas of quantum mechanics. More specifically, the spectral 
energy density per unit bandwidth, u

Equation 7.1 includes a number of constants including c 
the speed of light

the Planck constant, and kB 
the Boltzmann constant. Additionally, 
f 
is frequency in Hz, and T 
is temperature in kelvins. For a nice 
derivation, see [84, p. 186]. The first term represents the number of modes 
per unit frequency per unit volume while the second term represents the 
average energy per mode. The expression can be written as a function of 
wavelength instead of frequency with the substitution f 
= 

c 
. 

Photons emitted by a blackbody radiator have a relatively wide range of 
wavelengths, and this bandwidth depends on temperature. Figure 7.1 plots 
the energy density per unit bandwidth for blackbody radiators as a function 
of wavelength at temperatures 3000, 4000, and 5000 K. Room temperature 
corresponds to around 300 
K. Visible photons have wavelengths between

650 
nm. From the figure, we can see that black body 
radiators at higher temperatures emit both more photons and have a larger 
fraction of photons emitted fall in the visible range. 

7.2.3 Stimulated Emission 
Stimulated emission is the process in which an excited electron or molecule 
interacts with a photon, decays to an available lower energy level, and in 
the process gives off a photon. As with the other processes, this process 
can occur in isolated atoms, ionic compounds, organic molecules, and other 
types of materials, and it can occur in solids, liquids, and gases. If an incoming 
photon, with energy equal to the difference between allowed energy 
levels, interacts with an electron in an excited state, stimulated emission 
can occur. The energy of the excited electron will be converted to the 
energy of a photon. The stimulated photon will have the same frequency, 
direction, phase, and electromagnetic polarization as the incoming photon 
which initiated the process [10, p. 436].

Figure 7.2: Energy level diagrams illustrating absorption, spontaneous 
emission, and stimulated emission. 

7.2.4 Rate Equations and Einstein Coefficients 
The processes of absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission 
are illustrated by energy level diagrams in Fig. 7.2. Energy is on the 
vertical axis, and nothing is plotted on the horizontal axis. Only two energy 
levels are shown, so this diagram illustrates only a small fraction of possible 
energy levels of a material. The lower energy level is labeled 1. It may 
represent, for example, the highest occupied energy level of an electron in 
an isolated atom, or it may represent the valence band of a semiconductor. 
The higher energy level is labeled 2, and it may represent the lowest unoccupied 
energy level of an electron in an isolated atom or the conduction 
band of a semiconductor. The dot represents an electron occupying the 
energy level at the start of the process. The squiggly arrows represent a 
photon absorbed or emitted by the process. The vertical arrow shows how 
the internal energy of the electron changes in the process. During absorption, 
an electron takes energy from an incoming photon, and the internal 
energy of the electron increases. During spontaneous emission, the internal 
energy of an electron decreases, and a photon is emitted. Stimulated 
emission occurs when a photon, with energy equal to the energy gap of the 
levels, interacts with the electron. In the process, the electron decays to 
the lower energy level, and a photon is produced with the same frequency, 
direction, phase, and electromagnetic polarization as the original photon. 
The figures do not illustrate a change in position of the electrons. Instead, 
they illustrate a change in energy and internal momentum. 

The descriptions of the processes above involve changes in energy levels 
of an electron. However, absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated 
emission can instead involve vibrational energy states of molecules. For example, 
a photon may be absorbed by a molecule, and the energy may cause 
the molecule to go from one allowed vibrational state to another with higher 
internal energy. Similarly, this molecule may spontaneously decay from the 
higher energy state to a lower energy state emitting a photon by sponta

neous emission or by stimulated emission. An example involving molecular 
vibration states is a carbon dioxide laser. This laser produces infrared light 
by stimulated emission at λ 
= 
10:6 
m, and the stimulated emission occurs 
between allowed vibrational energy levels of the CO2 
molecule [31, p. 
217]. However, to simplify the discussion in this text, we will assume that 
electron energy levels are involved. This assumption is true in most, but 
not all, energy conversion devices. 

What factors determine the rate of these processes? Assume only two 
energy levels are involved. The number of electrons per unit volume in the 
lower state will be denoted n1, and the number of electrons per unit volume 
in the upper state will be denoted n2. 
The rate of absorption will be denoted 

dn2 
, the rate of spontaneous emission will be denoted dn2 
, and the 

dt 
abs 
dt 
spont 
rate of stimulated emission will be denoted dn2 
. Since only two energy

dt 
stim 


levels are involved in this system, we can describe the rates of the processes 
either in terms of the upper or lower energy levels. For example, we can 
write the rate of absorption either as the change in population density with 
respect to time of the upper state or the change in population density with 
respect to time of the lower state.

Absorption can only occur if there is an electron present in the lower 
energy level. Furthermore, the rate of absorption is proportional to the 
number of electrons in the lower state. Additionally, the rate of absorption 
depends on the number of incoming photons. As in Eq. 7.1, u 
represent 
the spectral energy density per unit bandwidth in units mJ
s 
3 
. We can model 
the rate of absorption in terms of these factors [84, ch. 6] [86, ch. 7].

The constant of proportionality B21 
is known as another Einstein B coe
fficient, and it also has units m3 
[84, ch. 6] [86, ch. 7]. The rate of

Js2 
stimulated emission is dependent on the number of electrons in the upper 
energy level. Stimulated emission requires an incoming photon, so the rate 
also depends on the spectral energy density per unit bandwidth u. 
By considering the factors that affect the rate of absorption, spontaneous 
emission, and stimulated emission, we can see some similarities and 
differences in the processes. As absorption occurs, the population of electrons 
in the upper energy level increases, and the population of the lower 
energy level decreases. As both spontaneous and stimulated emission occurs, 
the population of the upper energy level decreases, and the population 
of the lower energy level increases. Both the rate of absorption and the rate 
of stimulated emission depend on both the population of electrons in an 
energy level and the energy of incoming photons while the rate of spontaneous 
emission does not depend on the energy of incoming photons. This 
similarity between absorption and stimulated emission is reflected in the

Einstein showed that if one of the coefficients describing the absorption,

coefficients can be calculated from it. We can combine the terms above to

is called a population inversion [86, p. 189]. It only occurs when enough

means, so that there are more electrons in the upper energy level than the 
lower energy level. Population inversion has nothing to do with inversion 
symmetry discussed in Sec. 2.3.2. See Appendix C for a discussion of 
inversion and other overloaded terms. 

7.3 Devices Involving Spontaneous Emission 
Spontaneous emission occurs in many commercially available consumer 
products. This section discusses three categories of devices that convert 
electricity to light by spontaneous emission: incandescent lamps, gas discharge 
lamps, and LEDs. 

7.3.1 Incandescent Lamps 
An incandescent lamp is a device that converts electricity to light by blackbody 
radiation. These devices are typically constructed from a solid metal 
filament inside a glass walled vacuum tube. A current passes through the 
filament which heats it to a temperature of thousands of degrees. High 
temperatures are used because the visible spectral response of daylight is 
close to the visible spectral response of a blackbody radiator at a temperature 
of 6500 
K [87]. The main limitation of incandescent lamps is their 

 
148 7.3 Devices Involving Spontaneous Emission 

efficiency. Much of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody 
radiator falls outside the visible range. 

The main advantage of incandescent lamps over other technologies is 
their simplicity. For this reason, incandescent lamps were some of the 
earliest lamps developed. Humphry Davy demonstrated that blackbody 
radiation could be used to produce visible light in 1802, and practical incandescent 
lamps date to the 1850s [88]. In order to develop these practical 
incandescent lamps, vacuum pumping technology had to be developed, and 
technology to purify the metal used to make lamp filaments was required 
[88]. 

In some ways, an incandescent lamp is similar to an antenna. In both 
cases, the input takes the form of electricity, and this electrical energy is 
converted to electromagnetic energy by passing through a conducting wire. 
In an antenna, the input is time varying to encode information, and the 
output is at radio or microwave frequencies. However, in an incandescent 
lamp, the input is typically AC and does not contain information. The 
desired output of an incandescent lamp is visible light, but it also produces 
heat and electromagnetic radiation at infrared frequencies and at other 
non-visible frequencies. Additionally, antennas are typically designed to 
operate at a wavelength close to the length of the antenna, and such antennas 
can produce waves with specific electromagnetic polarization and 
radiation patterns. Spontaneous emission in incandescent lamps, however, 
is necessarily unpolarized and incoherent. 

7.3.2 Gas Discharge Lamps 
A gas discharge occurs when a conducting path forms through a plasma, 
an ionized gas [89]. Gas discharge devices convert electricity to light by 
spontaneous emission when this type of conducting path forms. In 1802 
in addition to demonstrating blackbody radiation and proposing the idea 
of a fuel cell, Humphry Davy demonstrated a gas discharge device [3, p. 

222] [88]. W. Petrov demonstrated a gas discharge around the same time 
[88]. One of the first practical gas discharge lamps, a carbon arc lamp, was 
built by Leon Foucoult in 1850, and it was used for theater lighting [88]. 
Development of gas discharge lamps required the ability to purify gases in 
addition to the development of vacuum pumping technology [88]. Examples 
of gas discharge devices in use today include include sodium vapor lamps, 
mercury arc lamps, fluorescent lamps, and neon advertising signs [89]. 
A gas discharge lamp is made from a sealed tube containing two electrodes 
and filled by a gas. The glass tube contains the gas, maintains the 
gas pressure, and keeps away impurities. The pressure of the gas inside the 

 
7 LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 149 

tube can range from 104 
Pa to 105 
Pa for different lamps [87, p. 206]. 
Typical electrode spacing is on the order of centimeters [87]. Some neon 
bulbs have an electrode spacing of 1 mm while many fluorescent tubes have 
an electrode spacing over 1 m. Hundreds to millions of volts are applied 
across the electrodes [89]. Transformers are used to achieve these high 
voltage levels. The voltage between the electrodes ionizes the gas inside 
the tube and provides a supply of free electrons which travel along the 
conducting path between the electrodes [89]. The gas may be ionized, and 
electrons supplied, by other methods such as chemical reactions, a static 
electric field, or an optical field instead [87, Ch. 5]. Electrons may also 
be supplied to the gas by thermionic emission, boiling electrons off the 
cathode. 

The optical properties of the lamp are determined by the gas inside 
the tube. Energy supplied by the electric field across the electrodes, or 
other means, excites electrons of the gas atoms to higher energy levels. 
Spontaneous emission occurs between distinct allowed energy levels only, 
so the emission occurs over relatively narrow wavelength ranges. Gases are 
chosen to have allowed energy level transitions in the desired wavelength 
range. Typical gases used include helium, neon, sodium, and mercury [87, 
p. 514]. 

Gas discharge lamps are classified as either glow discharge devices or arc 
discharge devices. Figure 7.3 shows an example plot of the current between 
electrodes as a function of voltage. As shown in the figure, the current-
voltage characteristic of a gas discharge tube is quite nonlinear. However, 
it can be broken up into three general regions, denoted the dark region, the 
glow region, and the arc region. The regions are distinguished by a change 
in slope of the current-voltage plot. This figure is used with permission 
from [89] which provides more details on the physics of gas discharges. 

The dark region of operation corresponds to low currents and voltages, 
and devices operating in this region are said to have a dark or Townsend 
discharge. Optical emission from devices operating in this region are not 
self sustaining. While atoms of the gas may ionize and collide with other 
atoms, no chain reaction of ionization occurs. The transition between the 
dark and glow discharges is called the spark [87, p. 160]. In Fig. 7.3, 
VS 
is the sparking voltage. The second region, corresponding to higher 
currents, is called the glow region, and this region is called self sustaining 
because ions collide and ionize additional gas atoms producing more free 
electrons in an avalanche process. Significant spontaneous emission occurs 
in the glow discharge region [87] [89]. The third region, corresponding to 
even higher current, is called the arc region. Arc discharges are also self 
sustaining [87, p. 290], and spontaneous emission is produced. Once the 

 
150 7.3 Devices Involving Spontaneous Emission 


Figure 7.3: Example current-voltage characteristics of a gas discharge 
lamp. Figure used with permission from [89]. 

arc discharge is established, relatively low voltages are required to maintain 
it compared to the voltages needed to maintain the glow discharge. 

Fluorescent lamps are a type of gas discharge device that involves the 
use of chemicals with desired optical properties, called phosphors [87, p. 
542]. The gas and electrode voltage used in fluorescent lamps is chosen 
to so that the spontaneous emission produced is at ultraviolet frequencies. 
These UV photons may be produced by either an arc or glow discharge. 
The UV photons produced are absorbed by the phosphor molecules, and the 
phosphor molecules emit light at lower frequencies. Examples of phosphors 
used include zinc silicate, calcium tungstate, and zinc sulfide [87, p. 542]. 

7.3.3 LEDs 
LEDs are devices that convert electricity to light by spontaneous emission. 
They are made from pn junctions in semiconductors. Pn junctions 
were discussed in Section 6.5. When a forward bias is applied across a pn 
junction, electrons and holes are injected into the junction. The energy 
from the power supply excites electrons from the valence to the conduction 
bands. These excited electrons can flow through the material much more 

 
7 LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 151 

easily than unexcited electrons. Some of the electrons and holes near the 
junction combine and spontaneously emit photons in the process. Some 
LEDs have a thin intrinsic, undoped, layer between the p-type and n-type 
layers at the junction to improve efficiency. 

LEDs emit light over a relatively narrow range of frequencies. The 
frequency of light emitted is determined by the energy gap of the semiconductor. 
Semiconductors are used because the energy gap of semiconductors 
corresponds to the energy of near ultraviolet, visible, or infrared 
photons. While light emitted by an LED has a narrow range of frequencies, 
lasers emit light with a much narrower range of frequencies. LEDs emit 
light within a narrow frequency range, but applications, such as residential 
lighting, require white light with a broader bandwidth. One strategy used 
to produce white light from an LED is to use phosphors. In such a device, 
an LED converts electricity to near UV or blue light. The phosphors absorb 
the blue light and emit light at lower energies, at wavelengths in the 
visible range. For this reason, blue LEDs were particularly important for 
generating white light. It took decades from the invention of red LEDs in 
the 1960s until reliable blue LEDs were developed in the 1980s and 1990s. 
In 2014, Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura were awarded 
the Nobel Prize in physics for their work developing blue LEDs. This effort 
required the development of deposition technology for new materials like 
gallium nitride, and it required being able to deposit these materials in 
very pure layers without mechanical strain tearing the materials apart [90]. 

A related device which emits light by spontaneous emission is an organic 
light emitting diode, OLED. In an OLED, a voltage excites electrons 
in a thin layer, 100-200 nm, of an organic material, and the type of organic 
material used determines the wavelength of light emitted [91]. Some flat 
panel displays are made from arrays of OLEDs. White light in these displays 
is achieved from a combination of red, green, and blue OLEDs near 
to each other [91]. 

LEDs are small devices that can often fit into a cubic millimeter. For 
this reason, they can be integrated into electronics more easily than devices 
like incandescent lamps and gas discharge lamps which require vacuum 
tubes. LEDs require low voltages electricity to operate. Since they require 
a small amount of input electrical power, they produce a small amount of 
output optical power. Incandescent lamps and gas discharge lamps have 
advantages in high power applications, but arrays of LEDs can also be used 
in these applications. Another advantage of LEDs is that they have a longer 
useful lifetime. In gas discharge lamps, the electrodes sputter, depositing 
material onto the surface of the tube, limiting the lifetime of the device. 

 
152 7.4 Devices Involving Stimulated Emission 

7.4 Devices Involving Stimulated Emission 
7.4.1 Introduction 
Lasers are devices that produce optical energy through stimulated emission 
and involve optical feedback. The word laser is an acronym for Light 
Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Lasers come in a wide 
range of sizes and shapes. Some lasers produce continuous output power, 
denoted cw for continuous wave, and other lasers operate pulsed. One advantage 
of pulsed operation is that the peak intensity of the light produced 
can be extremely high even with moderate average input power. Some 
lasers are designed to operate at room temperature while other lasers require 
external cooling. 

The development of many energy conversion devices required technological 
breakthroughs. The development of lasers, however, was preceded 
by breakthroughs in understanding of energy conversion processes in atoms 
and molecules. The idea of amplification by stimulated emission was first 
developed in the mid 1950s, [31, p. 183] [83, p. 687]. A maser, which operated 
at microwave frequencies, was demonstrated only a few years later by 
Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes in around 1955 [83, p. 687]. In 1960, a ruby 
laser with visible output at λ 
= 
694 
nm was demonstrated by Maiman, 
[83, p. 687]. Lasing in semiconductors was predicted in 1961 [92] and 
demonstrated within a year in gallium arsenide [93]. The development of 
semiconductor lasers required both the theoretical prediction as well as development 
in the ability to deposit pure thin semiconductor layers. Thin 
crystalline layers grown on top of a substrate are called epitaxial layers. 
Early semiconductor lasers were made by growing epitaxial layers from a 
liquid melt, through a process called liquid phase epitaxy [94]. In subsequent 
years, other methods which allowed more control and precision 
were developed including molecular beam epitaxy [95] and metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition [96].

Figure 7.4: Components of a laser. 

7.4.2 Laser Components 
Lasers have three main components: a power supply also called a pump, 
an active material, and a cavity. These components are illustrated in Fig. 

7.4 where mirrors form the cavity. Input energy from the power supply 
excites electrons or molecules in the active material. A photon interacts 
with the excited electrons or molecules of the active material stimulating 
the emission of a photon at the same frequency, phase, direction, and electromagnetic 
polarization. The cavity reflects the photon back to the active 
material so that it can stimulate another photon, and this process continues 
to occur as these photons stimulate additional identical photons. 
Pumps 

Laser power supplies are called pumps. Energy may be supplied to lasers 
in different ways. For many lasers, energy is supplied electrically. For 
example, the pump of a semiconductor laser is typically a battery which 
supplies a DC current. These lasers are energy conversion devices which 
convert the input electricity to light. For other lasers, energy is supplied 
optically, so the pump is a lamp or another laser. These lasers are energy 
conversion devices which convert light with large energy per photon to light 
with smaller energy per photon. The power supply of early ruby lasers were 
flashlamps [86, p. 351]. As another example, argon ion lasers are used to 
pump titanium doped sapphire lasers. Argon ion lasers can be tuned to 
emit photons with energy 2.54 eV (λ 
= 
488 
nm). These photons excite 
electrons in titanium doped sapphire. Titanium doped sapphire lasers are 
tunable solid state lasers which emit near infrared light [86, p. 392]. 

 
154 7.4 Devices Involving Stimulated Emission 

Active Materials 

Active materials can be solids, liquids, or gases, and lasers can be classified 
based on the state of matter of the active material. The active material of 
a laser has multiple allowed energy levels, and energy conversion occurs as 
the active material transits between energy levels. When an electron transits 
between energy levels, its internal momentum changes, not its spatial 
position. Typically, the pump excites an electron from a lower to higher 
allowed energy level, and a photon is emitted when the electron goes from 
a higher to lower energy level. In some lasers such as carbon dioxide lasers, 
however, molecular vibration states are involved instead of electron energy 
states. 

Optical amplification and lasing can only occur when there is a population 
inversion in the active material. The term population inversion means 
that more electrons are in the upper energy level than the lower energy 
level. The condition for a population inversion was defined by Eq. 7.19. A 
photon begins the process of stimulated emission, and another photon is 
produced in the process. Only in the case of a population inversion can the 
resulting photon be more likely to stimulate another photon than decay by 
spontaneous emission, by emitting phonons, or by other means. 

In some lasers, called two level lasers, the pump excites an electron 
from a lower energy level to a higher energy level, and lasing occurs as 
the electron transits back and forth between the same two levels. In other 
lasers, more energy levels must be considered. Figure 7.5 illustrates possible 
electron transitions in two, three, and four level lasers, but other three and 
four level schemes are possible too. In the three level system illustrated in 
the figure, the pump excites electrons from level one to level three. The 
electrons quickly decay to level two, possibly emitting heat, and lasing 
occurs as electrons transit from level two to level one. In the four level 
scheme illustrated, the pump excites electrons from level one to four. The 
electrons quickly decay from level four to three, emitting heat in the process. 
Lasing occurs between energy levels three and two. The electrons then 
decay between levels two and one, again emitting heat, vibration, or some 
other form of energy. Some four level systems lase more easily than two 
level systems because a population inversion may be easier to achieve in 
four than two level systems. Lasing requires a population inversion, and 
level two may be less likely to be occupied than level one.

Cavities 

Laser cavities have two main functions. They confine photons to the active 
material and they act as optical filters. The simplest optical cavity is made 
from two mirrors as shown in Fig. 7.4. This type of cavity is called a Fabry 
Perot cavity. More complicated cavities have multiple mirrors, lenses, and 
other optical components to focus the desired photons within the active 
material and reject photons at frequencies other than the desired frequency. 
Semiconductor lasers do not use separate mirrors to form the cavity. In 
some semiconductor lasers, the edges of the semiconductors act as mirrors 
because the index of refraction of the semiconductor is larger than that 
of the surrounding air thereby reflecting a portion of the light back inside 
the semiconductor. The edges of these lasers are formed by cleaving along 
crystal planes to produce extremely flat surfaces. In other semiconductor 
lasers, multiple thin layers of material act as mirrors. 

Even without an active material present, an optical cavity acts as an 
optical filter that selectively passes or rejects light of different wavelengths. 
To understand this idea, consider the rectangular cavity shown in Fig. 7.6. 
Assume that the cavity has partial mirrors on the left and right side so that 

 
156 7.4 Devices Involving Stimulated Emission 


Figure 7.6: The solid arrow shows the longitudinal direction while the 
dotted arrows show the transverse directions. The solid sinusoid shows an 
allowed longitudinal mode. The cavity length in the longitudinal direction 
is equal to 32 
λ 
. The dotted sinusoids show allowed transverse modes. The 
cavity lengths in the transverse directions are equal to λ 
2 
. 

some light can enter the cavity on the left side and some light can exit the 
cavity on the right. The direction along the length of the cavity, illustrated 
by the solid arrow, is called the longitudinal direction. The other two 
directions, illustrated by dotted arrows, are called transverse directions. If 
the longitudinal length of the cavity is exactly equal to an integer number 
of half wavelengths of the light, the wave will constructively interfere with 
itself. However, if the longitudinal length of the cavity is not equal to 
an integer number of half wavelengths, it will destructively interfere. The 
same ideas apply in the transverse directions. In the figure, the longitudinal 
length of the cavity is equal to three half wavelengths shown by the solid 
sinusoid. The transverse lengths are both equal to one half wavelength 
shown by the dotted sinusoids. Because of this constructive or destructive 
interference, cavities selectively allow certain wavelengths of light to pass 
through while they attenuate other wavelengths of light. In a typical laser 
cavity, the ratio of the longitudinal length to the transverse lengths is much 
larger than is shown in Fig. 7.6. Figure 7.6 illustrates a rectangular cavity 
while many lasers have cylindrical cavities instead. The same ideas apply, 
so only certain allowed longitudinal and transverse modes propagate in 
cylindrical cavities too [86, p. 133,145]. 

If there is a pump and an active material in a cavity, this filtering effect 
encourages lasing to occur at specific wavelengths due to the feedback the 
cavity provides. As discussed above, stimulated emission occurs when a 
photon interacts with an excited electron. The result is another photon of 
the same frequency, electromagnetic polarization, phase, and direction as 
the original photon. When the pump first turns on, electrons are excited, 
but no photons are present. Very soon, some photons are produced by 
spontaneous emission. Some of these photons stimulate the emission of additional 
photons. Since the cavity selectively attenuates some wavelengths 

 
7 LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 157 

but not others, photons produced by stimulated emission are more likely 
to occur at certain wavelengths corresponding to modes in the longitudinal 
direction. For these modes, the cavity length is equal to an integer multiple 
of half wavelengths. Due to the feedback of the laser cavity, these photons 
go on to stimulate additional identical photons. For this reason, the output 
of a laser necessarily has a very narrow wavelength range. 

7.4.3 Laser Efficiency 
The overall efficiency of a laser is the ratio of the output optical power 
over the input power. Many lasers are electrically pumped, and the overall 
efficiency, also known as the wall plug efficiency, for these lasers is the ratio 
of the output optical power over the input electrical power [10, p. 604].

The pump, active material, and cavity all affect a laser's efficiency. The 
overall efficiency is the product of a component due to the pump pump,a 
component due to the active material quantum, and a component due to 
the cavity cavity 
[86]. 

eff 
= 
pump 
· 
quantum 
· 
cavity 
(7.21) 

These factors vary widely from one type of laser to another. 

In an optically pumped laser, a lamp or another laser excites the electrons 
of the active material. In this case, some of the pump light may 
get reflected from the surface or transmitted through instead of absorbed 
by the active material. Also, some of the pump energy may be converted 
directly to heat. Additionally, especially in the case of lamps which emit 
light over a wide range of frequencies, the pump light may have too little 
energy per photon to excite the electrons, or the light may have too much 
energy per photon thereby exciting electrons to a different upper energy 
level. Also, some of the pump light may interact with electrons that are 
already in excited energy states. In an electrically pumped laser, electricity 
excites the electrons of the active material. Some of the electrical energy 
may be converted to heat instead of exciting the electrons. All of these factors 
involving the pump contribute to pump 
and the overall laser efficiency 
eff 
. 

The contribution to the overall laser efficiency due to the active material 
quantum 
is more commonly known as the internal quantum efficiency. 
Some fraction of excited electrons decay to a lower energy level and emit 

 
158 7.4 Devices Involving Stimulated Emission 

a photon by spontaneous or stimulated emission. Alternatively, other excited 
electrons decay to a lower energy level while emitting heat or lattice 
vibrations instead. The internal quantum efficiency is the ratio of the rate 
with which excited electrons decay and produce a photon over the rate at 
which all excited electrons decay [10, p. 562]. It depends on temperature, 
the concentration of impurities or crystalline defects, and other factors [10, 
p. 596]. 

Efficiency is also determined by the laser cavity. A laser cavity reflects 
photons towards the active material. However, the laser cavity must let 
some light exit. In many lasers, the cavity is formed by mirrors. While 
these mirrors reflect most of the light, some light is absorbed and some light 
is transmitted through the mirrors as laser output. Many lasers which use 
mirrors include lenses, prisms, and other optical components in the cavity 
to focus or filter light to the active material. These components may also 
reflect or absorb some light and thereby decrease the laser efficiency. As 
mentioned above, the cavity of many semiconductor lasers is formed by 
the interface between the active material and the surrounding air. While 
external mirrors can reflect over 99% of photons [86, p. 159], mirrors formed 
by semiconductor air interfaces are much less efficient. The amount of light 
reflected depends on the index of refraction of the material. In gallium 
arsenide, for example, the index of refraction is 3.52 which corresponds to 
only 31% of light reflected at each interface [97]. 

The influence on efficiency of internal absorption and mirror reflectivity 
can be summarized in a single relationship [98].

These efficiency concepts generalize to other energy conversion devices 
which produce light. Equation 7.20 also describes the overall efficiency of 
LEDs and lamps in addition to electrically pumped lasers. The concepts 

 
7 LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 159 

of efficiency due to the pump and internal quantum efficiency also apply to 
LEDs and lamps. However, cavity 
is not useful in describing these devices 
because LEDs and lamps do not contain a cavity. 

7.4.4 Laser Bandwidth 
Compared to LEDs and gas discharge lamps, incandescent lamps emit light 
over a much wider range of wavelengths. Compared to these devices, lasers 
emit light over a much narrower range of wavelengths. One reason that 
lasers emit over such a narrow wavelength range is that photons generated 
by stimulated emission have the same wavelength as the stimulating photon. 
As explained above, another reason is that only light at integer half 
multiples of the length of an optical cavity constructively interfere. 

This narrow bandwidth of lasers compared to other sources of light 
is a major advantage in many applications. For example, lasers generate 
communication signals sent down optical fibers. Multiple signals can simultaneously 
be sent down a single fiber with each signal produced by a 
laser at a slightly different frequency. Due to the narrow bandwidth, these 
signals can be separately detected at the receiver. 

Bandwidth of devices which emit light is typically specified by the full 
width half maximum bandwidth (FWHM). More specifically, intensity of 
light emitted is plotted as a function of wavelength where optical intensity 
is proportional to the square of the electric field. To find the FWHM, identify 
the wavelength of maximum intensity, and identify the wavelengths 
corresponding to half this intensity. The wavelength difference between 
these points of half intensity is called the FWHM, and this quantity is 
specified in meters or more likely nanometers. Sometimes FWHM is spec-
ified in units of Hz instead. A frequency response plot, showing intensity 
of light emitted versus frequency, is used to find FWHM in Hz. Again two 
points at half maximum intensity are identified on the plot. The frequency 
difference between these points of half intensity is the FWHM in Hz. A 
related measure is called the quality factor, and lasers with narrow bandwidth 
have high quality factor. It is defined as the ratio of the wavelength 
in nm of peak intensity emitted over the FWHM in nm. Alternatively, it 
is defined as the ratio of the frequency of peak intensity over the FWHM 
in Hz.

As an example, consider Figs. 7.7 and 7.8 which are from [99]. Figure

the organic dye rhodamine 6G mixed with silver nanoparticles. Curve a 
of 
Fig. 7.8 relates to a dye laser with rhodamine 6G as the active material. 
The other curves of Fig. 7.8 relate to dye lasers with active materials 
made from rhodamine 6G doped with various nanoparticles. Typically, 
lasing will only occur if the active material is pumped strongly enough. If 
less energy is supplied, spontaneous emission occurs. Above a threshold, 
some spontaneous emission still occurs, but stimulated emission dominates. 
Figure 7.7 plots the intensity of light emitted at two different pumping 
levels, above and below the threshold for lasing. From this figure, we 
can see that the bandwidth of light emitted when the device is producing 
only spontaneous emission is much broader than the bandwidth of light 
emitted when the device is lasing. The FWHM and quality factor in each 
case can be approximated from this figure. For the spontaneous emission 
curve, FWHM[nm] ≈ 
45 
nm and quality factor ≈ 
13. For the stimulated 
emission curve, FWHM[nm] ≈ 
5 
nm and quality factor ≈ 
115. While these 
values are for dye lasers, other types of lasers, especially gas lasers, can 
have FWHM values which are orders of magnitude smaller, and values of 

0.01 nm are achievable [83, p. 625]. Figure 7.8 illustrates another feature 
typical of lasers. Consider curve a 
which shows the intensity of the output 
versus pump energy supplied. The arrow in the figure near 65 mJ indicates 
the lasing threshold. Once lasing occurs, the intensity of the light emitted 
increases due to the optical feedback, so a discontinuity in the slope of plots 
of this type can be seen at the lasing threshold. 
7.4.5 Laser Types 
Engineers have developed many types of lasers utilizing a wide range of active 
materials. Lasers can be classified based on the type of active material 
as gas lasers, dye lasers, solid state lasers, or semiconductor lasers. Most 
lasers fit into one of these four categories, but there are exceptions such as 
free electron lasers where lasing occurs between energy levels of unbound 
electrons [31, p. 277] [86, p. 417]. 

Gas lasers 

In a gas laser, the active material is a gas, and lasing occurs between 
energy levels of a neutral or ionized atom. Gas lasers are constructed from 
a gas filled glass tube. Electrodes inside the tube supply power to excite 
electrons of the gas atoms, and external mirrors form the cavity. One of the 
more common gas lasers is the helium neon laser, which typically operates 
at 632.8 nm [31, ch. 10]. However, the laser cavity may be designed so 

 
162 7.4 Devices Involving Stimulated Emission 

that lasing occurs at 3.39 m and at other wavelengths too [31, ch. 10]. 
Another example of a common gas laser is the argon ion laser in which 
lasing occurs between energy levels of ionized argon. One advantage of 
gas lasers compared to other types of lasers is that they can be electrically 
pumped. Another advantage is that gas lasers can be designed to have 
high output powers. For this reason, gas lasers are used in applications 
requiring high power such as cutting, welding, and weaponry [86, p. 405]. 
Carbon dioxide lasers can produce hundreds of kilowatts of power when 
operating continuous wave and terawatts of power when operating pulsed 
[86, p. 405]. However, gas lasers are often physically large in size and not 
as portable as semiconductor lasers. High power gas lasers typically also 
require water cooling or another form of cooling. 

Dye Lasers 

In dye lasers, the active material is a solute in a liquid, and dye lasers are 
often optically pumped by other lasers [86, p. 386]. Lasing may occur 
between molecular vibration energy levels as opposed to electron energy 
levels [31, p. 225] [86, p. 386]. An advantage of dye lasers is that they may 
be tunable over a wide range of wavelengths. However, dye lasers require 
regular maintenance because the dyes have a finite useful lifetime [86, p. 
391]. One example of a dye used is the organic molecule rhodamine 6G, 
and lasers using this dye are tunable from 570 
<< 
610 
nm [31, p. 228] 
[86, p. 387]. Figures 7.7 and 7.8 illustrate the behavior of a dye laser of 
this type. 

Solid state lasers 

The active material of a solid state laser is a solid insulating material, often 
a high purity crystal, doped with some element. Lasing occurs between 
electron energy levels of the dopant embedded in the solid. External mirrors 
are used to form the cavity. Solid state lasers are typically optically pumped 
by lamps or other lasers. A ruby laser is a solid state laser with an active 
material made from a crystal of sapphire, Al2O3, doped with around 0.05% 
by weight of chromium Cr3+ 
ions [31, ch. 10 ]. Ruby lasers are three level 
lasers [10, p. 476]. Another common solid state laser is a neodymium 
yttrium aluminum garnet laser, often denoted Nd:YAG, which is a four 
level laser. The active material of this laser is yttrium aluminum garnet 
Y3Al5O12 
doped with around 1% of neodymium Nd3+ 
ions, and this laser 
produces infrared light at λ 
=1:0641 
m [10, p. 478] [31, p. 208] [86, p. 
539]. Another common laser is the titanium doped sapphire laser, denoted 

 
7 LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 163 

Ti:Sapph. The active material of this laser is sapphire Al2O3 
doped with 
about one percent of titanium ions Ti3+ 
. This laser is tunable in the range 
700 
<< 
1020 
nm [86, p. 392]. Tuning is achieved through an adjustable 
prism inside the laser cavity and through coatings on the mirrors of the 
cavity. Due to the tunability, these lasers are used for spectroscopy and 
materials research. 

Semiconductor lasers 

The active material of a semiconductor laser is a solid semiconductor pn 
junctions. An intrinsic, undoped, layer may be added between the p-type 
layer and the n-type layer at the junction to increase the width of the depletion 
region and improve overall efficiency [10, p. 567]. As with diodes 
and LEDs, the entire device typically fits inside a cubic millimeter. The 
wavelength emitted depends on the energy gap of the semiconductor. The 
first semiconductor lasers were made from gallium arsenide and produced 
infrared light [93]. Since then, semiconductor lasers emitting at all visible 
frequencies have been produced. It took over thirty years from the time the 
first semiconductors were produced to the time reliable blue lasers were produced 
[90] [100]. The first blue semiconductor lasers were produced using 
ZnMgSSe, and more commonly now GaN is used. Developing this technology 
required the ability to deposit very pure layers of the semiconductors 
without developing mechanical strain in the layers. 

Almost all semiconductor lasers are made from direct semiconductors. 
It is for this reason that the first semiconductor lasers were made from GaAs 
even though silicon processing technology was more developed at the time 
[93]. Direct semiconductors were defined in Section 6.4 and illustrated in 
Fig. 6.8. In a direct semiconductor, the top of the valence band and the 
bottom of the conduction band line up in a plot of energy levels versus

Figure 7.9 is a sketch of energy levels versus wave vector for a direct 
semiconductor and an indirect semiconductor. In both cases, an electron 
is excited to the conduction band. In both cases, the electron can decay 
by spontaneous emission from the conduction band to the valence band. 
In both cases, both energy and momentum must be conserved. In the 
direct semiconductor case, the electron can decay by emitting a photon. 
The electron does not need to change momentum in the process. While 
it is not shown in the figure, the electron can also decay by stimulated 
emission. In the indirect case, spontaneous emission can occur, but this 
process necessarily requires a change in momentum of the electron too. 
While it is possible that spontaneous emission can occur and produce a

photon, often the electron decays by producing heat or vibrations instead 
of a photon of light [86, p. 444]. For this reason, stimulated emission is 
significantly less likely to occur in indirect than direct semiconductors. 

As discussed above, semiconductor lasers do not have external mirrors. 
Semiconductor lasers can be broadly classified into two categories, 
edge emitters and vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) [101] 
depending on whether the optical emission is from the edge or the surface 
of the device. In edge emitting lasers, the cavity is often formed by the 
edges of the semiconductor. In other edge emitting lasers called distributed 
feedback semiconductor lasers, a grating, which acts as an optical filter, is 
etched into the semiconductor. In vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, 
multiple epitaxial layers of different materials form mirrors above and below 
the active material. 

A main advantage of semiconductor lasers over other types of lasers is 
their small size. They can be integrated into both consumer devices like 
laser pointers and DVD players as well as industrial equipment and communication 
networks. Another large advantage is that they are electrically 
pumped. They also often do not need external cooling due to their relatively 
high overall efficiency. Another advantage is that the output wavelength 
can be designed by selecting the composition. For example, semiconductor 
lasers of composition In1xGaxAs1yPy 
produce infrared light in 
the range 1:1 
m << 
1:6 
m. This frequency range is particularly useful 
for optical communication networks. Fiber optic cables are made from 
SiO2 
glass, a material with very low but nonzero absorption. Absorption 
is a function of wavelength, and the absorption minimum of silica glass is 
near 1:55 
m [10, p. 882]. These fibers also have low, but nonzero dispersion. 
Dispersion refers to the spread of pulses as they propagate through 

 
7 LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 165 

the fiber. The dispersion minimum in silica glass is around 1:3 
m. [10, 

p. 879]. Semiconductor lasers producing light in this range can be used to 
transmit signals down optical fibers, and these signals will have very low 
absorption and dispersion. A limitation is power output. While a semiconductor 
laser can produce over a watt of power, gas lasers can produce 
orders of magnitude more power. 
7.4.6 Optical Amplifiers 
Optical amplifiers are quite similar to lasers, and they can be made from all 
types of active materials used to make lasers including gases, solid state materials, 
semiconductors, and dyes [10, p. 477]. An optical amplifier consists 
of a pump and active material, but it does not have a cavity. The pump 
excites electrons of the active material to an upper energy level. Photons 
of an incoming optical signal cause additional photons to be generated by 
stimulated emission. Amplification occurs because these incoming photons 
generate additional photons, but lasing does not occur without the optical 
feedback provided by the cavity. 

Erbium doped fiber amplifiers are one of the most useful types of optical 
amplifiers because of their use in optical communication networks [10, p. 
882]. These devices can amplify optical signals without the need to convert 
them to or from electrical signals. They are solid state devices where 
stimulated emission occurs between energy levels of erbium, a dopant, in 
silica glass fibers. Energy from a semiconductor laser acts as the pump 
which excites electrons of the erbium atoms. Erbium doped fiber amplifi
ers are very useful because they can amplify optical signals near the fiber 
absorption minimum at 1.55m.

168 7.5 Relationship Between Devices 

Scientists have come up with a wide variety of devices that convert 
between electricity and light, and they have come up with a wide variety 
of applications for these devices. Covering all such devices and all their 
applications is beyond the scope of this text. However, this chapter has 
shown some of the variety of devices. One way to classify devices which 
convert between electricity and light is to group them into categories based 
on whether they primarily involve absorption, spontaneous emission, or 
stimulated emission. Figure 7.10 illustrates how to classify many of the 
devices discussed in this chapter in this way. Ovals indicate absorption, 
rounded rectangles indicate spontaneous emission, and rectangles indicate 
stimulated emission. In the figure, thick borders indicate categories of devices 
while thin borders indicate example types of devices. Dotted lines 
indicate devices with gaseous active materials, dashed lines indicate semi-
conducting active materials, mixed dotted and dashed lines indicate solid 
state active materials, widely spaced dotted lines indicate conductive active 
materials, and solid lines indicate mixed or other active materials. 

This diagram is far from complete because many other categories of 
devices exist, and these categories may be broken into further subcategories. 
Furthermore, only a handful of example devices are shown relating to some 
of the specific devices discussed above. This diagram includes absorption 
based devices discussed in Chapter 6. It also includes antennas discussed in 
Chapter 4. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in 
the visible range. Light can be absorbed by a solar cell and spontaneously 
emitted by an LED, for example. Similarly, electromagnetic waves at longer 
wavelengths can be absorbed or spontaneously emitted by antennas which 
are devices with conductive active materials. 

A different way of classifying devices which convert between electricity 
and light is to classify them based on the type of active material. All of 
these devices involve the interaction of light and atoms. The atoms involved 
may be part of a gas, may be dopants inside an insulating solid, may be 
part of a bulk semiconductor material, or may be part of a conductive 
solid. This way of classifying devices is illustrated in the Fig. 7.11. Dotted 
lines indicate devices with gaseous active materials, dashed lines indicate 
semiconducting active materials, mixed dotted and dashed lines indicate 
solid state active materials, widely spaced dotted lines indicate conductive 
active materials, and solid lines indicate mixed or other active materials. 
As in the previous figure, ovals indicate absorption, rounded rectangles 
indicate spontaneous emission, and rectangles indicate stimulated emission. 
Antennas are shown twice in the conductor based devices category because 
receiving antennas involve absorption while transmitting antennas involve 
spontaneous emission. Also as in the previous figure, thick borders indicate 

 
7 LAMPS, LEDS, AND LASERS 169 

categories of devices while thin borders indicate example types of devices. 
Again, this figure does not show a complete list of all possible devices or 
device categories, but it does illustrate relationships between some devices 
discussed in this chapter. 

Devices are usually designed to involve only one of these processes of 
absorption, spontaneous emission, or stimulated emission. However, it is 
possible for multiple of these processes to occur in a single device depending 
on how it is operated. For example, a semiconductor laser converts 
electricity to light by stimulated emission when current above the lasing 
threshold is supplied. If a weaker current is supplied, the device will act 
as an LED which converts electricity to light by spontaneous emission. If 
light shines on the device and the voltage across the device is measured, 
the same device acts as a photodetector which converts light to electricity 
by absorption. Similarly, photomultiplier tubes, gas discharge lamps, and 
gas lasers all involve tubes of gas with electrodes to supply or measure 
electricity. Like many energy conversion devices, these devices may convert 
electricity to light when operated in one direction and convert light to 
electricity when operated in reverse.

8 Thermoelectrics 

8.1 Introduction 
A thermoelectric device is a device which converts a temperature differential 
to electricity, or vice versa, and it is made from a junction of two different 
conductors or semiconductors. To understand thermoelectric devices, 
we need to understand the fundamentals of heat transfer and thermodynamics. 
This chapter begins by discussing these fundamental ideas. Next, 
thermoelectric effects and thermoelectric devices are discussed. 

Many common processes heat an object. Rubbing blocks together, for 
example, heats them by friction. Burning a log converts the chemical energy 
in the wood to thermal energy, and applying a current to a resistor also 
heats it up. How can we cool an object? If we supply electricity to a 
thermoelectric device, one side heats up and the other cools down. We can 
place the object we want to cool near the cooler side of the thermoelectric 
device. 

Thermoelectric devices, pyroelectric devices, and thermionic devices all 
convert energy between a temperature difference and electricity. Pyroelectric 
devices were discussed in Sec. 3.2. They are made from an insulating 
material instead of from a junction of conductors or semiconductors. 
Thermionic devices are discussed in Sec. 10.2, and they involve heating a 
cathode until electrons evaporate off. Thermoelectric devices, discussed 
in this chapter, are much more common than pyroelectric devices and 
thermionic devices due to their efficiency and durability. 

8.2 Thermodynamic Properties 
A container of air of fixed mass confined to a volume stores energy. We can 
shrink the volume of the air. This process requires energy, and the shrunken 
volume of air stores more energy. We can increase the gas pressure, for 
example, by exerting a force on a piston within which air is confined. This 
process requires energy, and the air under pressure stores more energy. We 
can take the fixed volume of air and heat it too. It takes energy to heat 
the air, and the hotter air stores more energy. Similarly, we can shake 
the container of air. Again, this process requires energy, and the energy 
from shaking is stored in the internal energy, the random motion, of the 
air molecules. 

To talk about thermodynamic energy conversion, we need to define four 
fundamental properties of a system: volume, pressure, temperature, and 
entropy. All of these properties depend on the current state, not the past

history, of the sample. These properties can be classified as intensive or 
extensive [2, p. 10]. An intensive property is independent of the size or 
extent of the material. An extensive property depends on the size or extent 
[2, p. 10]. 

Volume V 
is an extensive property measured in m3 
or liters where 1 
L =

m3 
. Pressure P 
is an intensive property measured in the SI units of 
pascals where 1 Pa=1 mN 
2 
. Pressure is also measured in a wide variety 
of other, non-SI, units such as bars, millimeters of mercury, or standard 
atmospheres as listed in Table 8.1. Pressure measures are often specified in 
comparison to the lowest possible pressure, of a complete vacuum, and such 
pressure measurements are called absolute pressure measurements [102, p. 
15-17]. In some cases, values are specified as the difference above the local 
atmospheric pressure, and these measurements are called gauge pressure 
measurements [102, p. 15-17]. In other cases, values are specified as the 
difference below the local atmospheric pressure, and these measurements 
are called vacuum pressure measurements [102, p. 15-17]. Unless otherwise 
specified, the term pressure in this text refers to absolute pressure, not 
gauge or vacuum pressure.

As with absolute pressure measurements, temperature in kelvins is said to 
be measured on an absolute temperature scale because the lowest possible 
temperature is given by zero kelvin. All temperatures are either absolute 
zero or have positive values. We use the term temperature to describe 
a property of a system. We use the term heat transfer to describe the 
process of transferring energy from a hot to a cold object. Entropy S 
is 
measured in units JK, and it is an extensive property. Intuitively, entropy 
is a measure of the lack of order or organization of a material. The atoms 
in an amorphous material are less ordered than the atoms in a crystal of 
the same composition, so the amorphous material has more entropy. 

Some further definitions will be needed. The symbol N 
represents the 
number of atoms or molecules of a substance. While it is not usually 
considered a fundamental thermodynamic property, it is a useful property 
of a sample. Sometimes it is specified in the units of mols instead of by the 
number of atoms or molecules. The Avogadro constant

8.3 Bulk Modulus and Related Measures 
The bulk modulus B 
describes how a gas, liquid, or solid changes as it is 
compressed [103]. More specifically, bulk modulus per unit volume is the 
change in pressure required to get a given compression of volume, 

@P

B 
= 
V 
(8.7)

@V 


and bulk modulus is specified in the SI units of pascals or mN 
2 
. 
The bulk 
modulus is greater than zero (B 
> 
0) 
even though there is a minus sign in 
Eq. 8.7 because volume shrinks when pressure is applied. Table 8.4 lists 
example bulk modulus values. 

Assuming constant temperature, the inverse of the bulk modulus B 
1 
, 
is also called the isothermal compressibility [108]. There is a relationship 
between this compressibility and the permittivity 
discussed in Chapter 

2. If we take an insulating material and apply an external electric field, 
a material polarization is established, and energy is stored in this charge 
accumulation. The permittivity is a measure of the charge accumulation 
 
8 THERMOELECTRICS 177

Both Eqs. 8.8 and 8.9 can be called constitutive rela-

influence is applied. 

Multiple other measures describe the variation of a gas, liquid, or solid, 
with respect to variation of a thermodynamic property. The specific heat 
describes the ability of a material to store thermal energy, and it has units 

J 

gK [109, p. 98]. More specifically, the specific heat over temperature is 
equal to the change in entropy with respect to change in temperature [108]. 
It may be given either assuming a constant volume or assuming a constant 
pressure.

energy is held fixed but entropy is allowed to vary, some materials cool and 
others heat. So, this coefficient may be positive, negative, or even zero at 
an inversion point. Additionally, the volume expansivity is defined as

178 8.4 Ideal Gas Law 

8.4 Ideal Gas Law 
In most materials, if we know three of the four thermodynamic properties, 
volume, pressure, temperature, and entropy, we can derive the fourth property 
as well as other thermodynamic measures. Such materials are called 
simple compressible systems [109, 102]. For such materials, the ideal gas 
law relates pressure, volume, and temperature. 

PV 
= 
NRT. 
(8.14) 

While this is not a mathematical law, it is a good description of gases, and 
it can be used as a rough approximation for liquids and solids. Consider 
a container filled with a gas. If the volume of the container is compressed 
while the temperature is kept constant, the pressure increases. If the gas is 
heated and the pressure is kept constant, the volume increases. The energy 
stored in a gas that undergoes change in volume at constant temperature 
is given by 



E 
= 
PdV 
(8.15) 

where the change in energy is specified by 

E 
= 
PV. 
(8.16) 

The ideal gas law can be written incorporating entropy as 

PV 
= 
ST. 
(8.17) 

For example, consider a 10 L tank that holds 5 mol of argon atoms. The 
argon gas is at a temperature of T 
= 
15 
C. Find the pressure in the tank 
in pascals and in atm. We begin by converting the volume and temperature 
to more convenient units, V

m3 
and T 
= 
288:15 
K. Next, the ideal 
gas law provides the pressure in Pa.

8.5 First Law of Thermodynamics 
The idea of energy conservation was introduced in Sec. 1.3. Most discussions 
of thermodynamics also begin with the same idea. The first law 
of thermodynamics is a statement of energy conservation. Energy can be 
stored in the material polarization of a capacitor, the chemical potential 
of a battery, and in many other forms. People studying thermodynamics 
and heat transfer, however, often make some drastic assumptions. They 
classify all energy conversion processes as heat transfer or other where the 
primary component of the latter is mechanical work. At the beginning 
of introductory thermodynamics courses, all forms of energy besides heat 
transfer and mechanical work are ignored. Charging a capacitor, discharging 
a battery, and all other energy conversion processes are grouped in with 
mechanical work when writing the first law of thermodynamics. The first 
law of thermodynamics is typically written as 

(change in int. energy)=(heat in) 
 
(work and other forms) 
. 
(8.21) 

U 
= 
Q 
W 
(8.22) 

Each term of the Eq. 8.22 has the units of joules. The symbol Q 
represents 
the energy supplied in to the system by heating, and W 
, with the minus 
symbol, represents the mechanical work in to the system as well as all 
other forms of energy into the system. The quantity U 
represents the 
change in internal energy of the system. In a closed system the total energy 
is conserved. In a closed system, energy is either stored in the system 
(for example as potential energy or another form of internal energy), is 
transfered in or out as heat, or is transfered in or out as another form such 
as mechanical work [109, p. 51].

As an example, consider the closed system shown on the left part of 
Fig. 8.1 comprised of a cylinder with a piston and a heater. Assume the 
cylinder contains a fixed volume of gas inside. Suppose the heater is used 
to transfer 100 J of energy into the piston in an hour while the piston is 
forced to remain in a fixed position. After the hour, the internal energy of 
the gas will be 100 J greater than before. Again suppose the heater is used 
to transfer 100 J of energy into the gas, but this time assume the piston 
is allowed to move thereby expanding the gas volume. After the hour, the 
internal energy of the gas will be the original energy of the gas, plus the 
100 J supplied by the heater, and minus a factor due to the mechanical 
work done by the piston. 

The first law of thermodynamics says two things. First, energy is conserved. 
Second, energy can be stored, converted to mechanical work, or 
converted to heat. We know energy can be converted to other forms too, 
like electrical or electromagnetic energy. While introductory thermodynamics 
classes do not usually do so, we can add other devices to the piston 
as shown on the right part of Fig. 8.1. We can include a battery and put a 
resistor inside to convert the chemical energy to electrical energy, and the 
resistor can heat the air in the piston. We can put a mass and a spring in 
the piston and convert potential energy of a compressed spring to kinetic 
energy by removing a clip which holds the spring compressed. In a closed 
system when all energy conversion processes are considered, energy must 
be conserved. 

8.6 Thermoelectric Effects 
8.6.1 Three Related Effects 
In the 1800s, three effects were experimentally observed. At first, it was 
not obvious that these experiments were related, but soon they were found

Seebeck EffectPeltier EffectThomson EffecthotcoldIhotcold12+V12
12Iheating/coolingheating/cooling
Figure 8.2: The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect. 

to be three aspects of the same phenomenon [5, p. 113]. 

The first effect, now called the Seebeck effect, was discovered in 1821 
by Thomas Seebeck [5, p. 113]. It is observed in a junction of two different 
metals or semiconductors. As discussed in Section 6.5, junctions are 
also used to make photovoltaic devices, LEDs, and semiconductor lasers. 
When the different sides of the junction are held at different temperatures, 
a voltage develops across the junction. The Seebeck coefficient $, in units 
KV, is defined as the ratio of that voltage to the temperature difference. 
More specifically, consider a junction where one side is held at a hotter 
temperature than the other, as shown in the left part of Fig. 8.2. The difference 
between the Seebeck coefficient in material one $1 
and the Seebeck 
coefficient in material two $2 
is given by the measured voltage across the 
junction V12 
divided by the temperature difference between the materials 
T12 
[110, p. 24]. 

V12

$2

T12 


The difference between the Seebeck coefficients can be positive or negative 
because both the temperature difference and the measured voltage can be 
positive or negative. However, for any given material, the Seebeck coefficient 
is positive. To find the Seebeck coefficient for an unknown material, 
form a junction between that material and a material with known Seebeck 
coefficient, heat one end of the junction hotter than the other, and measure 
the voltage established. For most materials, the Seebeck coefficient is 

V

less than 1 
Some of the largest values of the Seebeck coefficient are

K. 
found in materials containing tellurium. For example, (Bi0:7Sb0:3)2 
Te3 
has 
$ 
≈ 
230 
V and PbTe has $ 
≈ 
400 
V [3].

KK 

To understand the physics behind the Seebeck effect, consider the flow 
of charges across this diode-like device. In metals, valence electrons are the 
charge carriers, and in semiconductors, both valence electrons and holes 
are the charge carriers. These charge carriers diffuse from the hot to the 
cold side of the junction. Consider a junction of two metals with no net 

 
182 8.6 Thermoelectric Effects 

charge on either side initially. If an electron moves from the hot side to the 
cold side, the hot side then will have a net positive charge, and the cold 
side will have a net negative charge. This movement of charges sets up an 
electric field and hence a voltage. 

If we let the sample reach an equilibrium temperature, no voltage will 
be measured. A voltage is measured only during the time when charge 
carriers have diffused from one material to the other but when the material 
has not reached a uniform temperature. Thus, for a material to have a 
large thermoelectric effect, it must have a large electrical conductivity and 
small thermal conductivity. Thermoelectric devices are typically made from 
metals or semimetals because these materials satisfy this condition. 

The second effect was discovered by Jean Peltier in 1834 [5, p. 113]. 
The Peltier effect is also observed in a junction of two different metals, 
semimetals, or semiconductors. It is illustrated in the middle part of Fig. 

8.2. When a current, I 
in amperes, is supplied across a junction, heat is 
transferred. This effect occurs because charges from the supplied current 
flow through different materials with different thermal conductivities on 
the different sides of the junction. The effect is quantified by the Peltier 
coefficient for the junction, 12, or Peltier coefficients for the materials 
forming the junction, 1 
and 2. More specifically, the Peltier coefficient 
is defined as  
dQ 


12 
=1 
 
2 
= 
dt 
(8.24)

I 


in the units of volts [110, p. 24]. The term ddt 
Q 
represents the rate heat is 
transferred in Js , and it may be positive or negative because the thermal 
conductivity in the first material may be higher or lower than in the second 
material. The Seebeck coefficient and the Peltier coefficient are related by

The third effect was first discovered by William Thomson in the 1860s 
[3]. Thomson also derived the relationship between these three effects. It 
is illustrated on the right part of Fig. 8.2. When a current passes through 
a uniform piece of material which has a temperature gradient, heating or 
cooling will occur, and this result is known as the Thomson effect [3, p. 

148] [110, p. 24] [5, p. 115]. To observe this effect, apply a temperature 
 
8 THERMOELECTRICS 183 

gradient across a piece of metal or semiconductor and also apply a current 
through the length of the material. Heating or cooling can be measured, 
and this effect is described by another coefficient. The Thomson coefficient 
τ 
also has units KV. It is defined as the rate of heat generated over the 
product of the current and temperature difference.

These effects work both ways. We can use the Peltier effect, for example, 
to make either a heating or a cooling device. We can supply a current 
across a junction to produce a temperature differential, or we can supply 
a temperature difference to generate a current. All three effects relate to 
the fact that when the electrical conductivity is larger than the thermal 
conductivity, energy can be converted between a temperature differential 
and electricity. As an aside, materials with low electrical conductivity and 
high thermal conductivity are also used to make energy conversion devices. 
Components of motors and generators are often made from layers of metal 
and dielectrics with these properties [111, ch. 8]. 

8.6.2 Electrical Conductivity 
Electrical conductivity ff, in units 
· 
1 
m, is a measure of the ability of charges 
to flow through a material. Resistivity is the inverse of electrical conductivity, 
ρ 
= 
σ 
1 
. Example electrical conductivity values are listed in Table 8.4, 
found in Section 8.3. Few tools are needed to measure these quantities. 
An ohmmeter can be used to find the resistance R, in ohms, of a sample 
with known length l 
and cross sectional area A. The conductivity can be 
calculated directly, 

l 


σ 
= 
. 
(8.29)

AR 


Electrical conductivity is the product of the number of charges flowing 
and their mobility. For conductors, valence electrons are charge carriers 
that flow, so conductivity can be expressed as [9, p. 84] 

σ 
= 
nqn. 
(8.30) 

 
184 8.6 Thermoelectric Effects 

In this expression, n 
is the concentration of valence electrons in units 
electrons 

m
m
3 
, and it was introduced in Sec. 5.2. The magnitude of the charge 
of an electron is q 
=1:6 
· 
1019 
C. 
Mobility of electrons, n, is the ease 
with which charge carriers drift in a material, and it has units Vm 
· 
2 
s. By 
definition, mobility is the ratio of the average drift velocity of electrons to 
the applied electric field in V [9, p. 84]. 

m

n

(8.31)

For semiconductors, both electrons and holes act as charge carriers, and 
both contribute to the conductivity, 

σ 
= 
q 
(nn 
+ 
pp) 
(8.32) 

where p 
is the mobility of the holes, and p 
is the concentration of holes. 

To understand which materials have large electrical conductivities, and 
hence make good thermoelectric devices, we need to consider the charge 
concentrations n 
and p. Conductors and semiconductors have charges that 
can move through the material while insulators do not. Thus conductors 
and semiconductors have large electrical conductivity and are used 
to make thermoelectric devices. Furthermore, a doped semiconductor has 
more charge carriers than an undoped, also called intrinsic, semiconductor. 
Thus, doped semiconductors usually have higher electrical conductivity 
than undoped semiconductors of the same material [110]. 

Electrical conductivity σ 
is proportional to the electron and hole mobilities, 
n 
and p, and the mobilities are a strong function of temperature 
[9]. For this reason, the electrical conductivity is a function of temperature. 
At low temperature, mobilities are limited by impurity scattering 
while at high temperatures, they are limited by phonon scattering. At 
some intermediate temperature, mobility and conductivity are maximum, 
and this peak occurs at different temperatures for different materials. Mobility 
also depends on whether a material is crystalline or amorphous and 
on the degree of crystallinity. Mobility and electrical conductivity are both 
typically higher in crystals than glasses because charges are more likely to 
get scattered in amorphous materials. 

8.6.3 Thermal Conductivity 
Thermal conductivity κ 
is a measure of the ability of heat to flow through a 
W

material, and it has units [109, p. 793]. Example thermal conductivity

heatsinkheaterthermocouples
Figure 8.3: Components used to measure thermal conductivity. 

values are listed in Table 8.4, found in Section 8.3. Understanding thermal 
conductivity is complicated because a number of mechanisms are responsible 
for the conduction of heat. Heat may be transported by phonons, 
photons, electrons, or other mechanisms, and each mechanism depends on 
temperature and the properties of the material. Good thermoelectric devices 
have small thermal conductivity. Often metals have large thermal 
conductivity and insulators have small thermal conductivity. 

The apparatus to measure thermal conductivity consists of a heater, a 
heat sink, and a number of thermocouples [110] [112]. To measure thermal 
conductivity experimentally, start with a bar of material with a known 
cross sectional area A. Heat one end of the bar with respect to the other, 
wait for a steady thermal state, and measure the temperature at each end 
of the bar. Next, calculate the temperature gradient dT 
in units K along

dx 
m 
the length of the bar. Also measure the rate that heat is supplied to the 

bar, ddt 
Q, in units Js . By definition, thermal conductivity is the ratio 

(power dissipated in heater)(distance between thermocouples) 

κ 
= 


(cross sectional area)(change in temp) 
(8.33) 
[109, p. 49]. The thermal conductivity can be calculated from

This technique works well for low to moderate temperatures and materials 
with high thermal conductivity. Other methods exist to measure thermal 
conductivity and are advantageous for different temperature or conductivity 
ranges. 

Another way to understand thermal conductivity is to think of it as 
the product of the amount of heat transported by some particle times the 
velocity of that particle. This viewpoint applies whether or not actual 
particles are involved in the heat transport. More specifically, thermal

represents the specific heat at constant volume in gK, and 

!

the symbol j 
v 
| 
represents the magnitude of the transport velocity in ms . 
The scattering length is represented by l 
in m. 

Regardless of whether electrons, phonons, or something else transports 
heat through a material, the ability of that heat to get from one end to 
the other without being scattered or blocked influences the thermal conductivity. 
Thus, crystals typically have higher thermal conductivity than 
amorphous materials [113]. The thermal conductivity of a crystal can be 
lowered by exposing the material to radiation which destroys the crystallinity 
and increases the likelihood that the heat carrier will be scattered 
[110]. For glasses, scattering length is roughly the interatomic spacing [112]. 
Also, thermal conductivity of glasses is less temperature dependent than 
crystals because high temperatures distort the perfect crystallinity, thereby 
lowering the thermal conductivity for crystals but not glasses [113]. 



 


All the contributing factors, Cv, jv 
j, 
and scattering length l, are temperature 
dependent, so the thermal conductivity is a function of temperature. 
The temperature dependence of the factors is discussed in reference [110]. 
Thermal conductivity, like electrical conductivity, is low at low temperatures 
then rises to a maximum before decreasing again at higher temperatures 
[112]. 

8.6.4 Figure of Merit 
The figure of merit of a thermoelectric device, Z, is a single measure that 
summarizes how good a material is for making thermoelectric devices. It 
is defined as 

$2σ 


Z 
= 
, 
(8.36)

κ 


and it has units K1 
. It depends on the Seebeck coefficient $, electrical 
conductivity ff, and thermal conductivity . A large value of Z 
indicates 
that the material is a good choice for use in construction of a thermoelectric 
device. 

The figure of merit depends on temperature because the parameters 
$, 
ff, 
and κ 
are strong functions of temperature. Thus, the best choice material 
for a thermoelectric device operating near room temperature may not 
be the best choice for a device operating at other temperatures. Sometimes 
ZT 
is used as a measure instead of just Z 
to account for the temperature 
dependence. 

 
8 THERMOELECTRICS 187 

The figure of merit does not incorporate all of the temperature related 
factors to consider in selecting materials for thermoelectric devices. Melting 
temperature is also important. A thermoelectric device converts more 
energy when a larger temperature difference is placed across the device. 
The Seebeck coefficient is inversely proportional to the temperature differential, 
$= 

Δ 
V
T 
. However, too large of a temperature differential will melt 
the hot end of the device, and different materials can have very different 
melting temperatures. For example, lead telluride PbTe melts at 924 C, 
and Bi2Te3 
melts at 580 
C [114, p. 4-52, 4-71]. 

The figure of merit also depends on doping level because the electrical 
conductivity is directly proportional to the charge concentrations n 
and p 
[110]. Thus, a thermoelectric device made from a doped semiconductor has 
a higher electrical conductivity and thermoelectric efficiency than a device 
made from an undoped semiconductor of the same material. The Seebeck 
coefficient is also dependent on doping level but not as strongly [110]. Thermal 
conductivity is not a strong function of charge concentrations n 
and p 
[110]. Thus, thermoelectric materials are often made from heavily doped 
semiconductors or from conductors. 

The figure of merit also depends on degree of crystallinity. Typically, 
both the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity are much higher 
in crystals than glasses because charge and heat carriers are less likely to 
get scattered as they travel through crystals than glasses [113]. Since both 
electrical and thermal conductivity are influenced, the effect of degree of 
crystallinity on the figure of merit can be complicated. 

Thermoelectric devices are typically made from junctions of two different 
metals or semiconductors. Essentially, a thermoelectric device is a 
diode. Common materials used include bismuth telluride, lead telluride, 
and antimony telluride, all of which are semimetals. Bi, Sb, and Pb are all 
located near each other on the periodic table. Other materials studied for 
use in thermoelectric devices include [110], BiSeTe, LiMnO, LiFeO, LiCoO, 
LiNiO, PbS, and ZnSb. These materials are either small gap semiconductors 
or semimetals. In semiconductor materials with small energy gaps, the 
ratio of electrical conductivity to thermal conductivity is large. However, 
this fact must be balanced against the fact that smaller gap semiconductors 
tend to have lower melting temperatures than larger gap semiconductors 
[110, ch. 1]. 

Recently, layered materials and superlattices have been considered as 
materials for thermoelectric devices [115] [116]. The layers can be tailored 
to affect the thermal and electrical properties differently and can act like 
a filter to select out different conduction mechanisms. Understanding of 
the conductivity mechanisms is a prerequisite to understanding such more

complicated structures. 

8.7 Thermoelectric Efficiency 
8.7.1 Carnot Efficiency 
Many devices convert a temperature difference to another form of energy. 
For example, thermoelectric devices and pyroelectric devices convert a temperature 
difference to electricity, and Stirling engines and steam turbines 
convert a temperature difference to mechanical work. There is a fundamental 
limit to the efficiency of any device that converts a temperature 
difference into another form of energy. The Carnot efficiency is the maximum 
possible efficiency of such an energy conversion process. 

Consider a thermoelectric device made from a junction of two materials 
that converts a temperature difference to electricity using the Seebeck 
effect. Assume that one end of the device is connected to a heater, and the 
other end of the device is connected to a heat sink so that it is at a lower 
temperature. The temperature of the hot side of the device is denoted Th, 
and the temperature of the cold side of the device is denoted Tc. Both 
temperatures are measured in kelvins, K (or another absolute temperature 
measure such as Rankine). Assume that the only energy conversion process 
that occurs converts energy from the temperature difference to electricity. 
Furthermore, assume that energy is continuously supplied from the heater 
at a constant rate to maintain the hot end of the device at temperature 
Th. The heater is supplying heat to the room it is in. However, assume 
that the room is so large and the amount of heat from the heater is so 
small that the temperature of the room remains roughly constant. For this 
reason, we say that the room is a thermodynamic reservoir. Also, assume 
that we have waited long enough that the temperature of the device has 
reached a steady state. The temperature is not constant along the length 
of the device, but it no longer varies with time. 

The input to this system is the thermal energy supplied from the heater, 
Ein. The output of this system is the electrical energy extracted out, Eout. 
The device is not used up in the process, so the number of atoms in the 
device remains constant. As long as energy is supplied from the heater 
at a constant rate to maintain the hot side at temperature Th, we can 
extract electrical energy out of the system at a constant rate. Heat transfer 
scientists call this type of process a thermodynamic cycle or a heat engine. 
A thermodynamic cycle is a sequence of energy conversion processes where 
the device begins and ends in the same state. In a thermodynamic cycle, 
energy is supplied in one form and is extracted in another form. The device 

 
8 THERMOELECTRICS 189 

or mass involved starts and ends in the same state, so the processes can 
continue indefinitely as long as the input is continually supplied. 

How much energy is supplied in to the system from the heater? The 
amount of energy required to maintain the hot side at temperature Th 
is 
given by 

Ein 
= 
kBTh. 
(8.37) 

The device is composed of atoms. Each of these atoms has some internal 
energy. A device at temperature T 
contains kBT 
joules of energy where 
kB 
is the Boltzmann constant. Energy flows from the hot side to the cold 
side of the device. Above, we assumed that the device was in a room that 
was so large that the heat from the heater did not raise the temperature of 
the room. Thus, we must continually supply this energy at a constant rate 
to keep the hot side of the device at temperature Th. 
While the cold side 
of the device is at a lower temperature Tc, it maintains that temperature 
regardless of the fact that there is a heater in the room. 

How much energy is extracted out of the system as electrical energy? 
In the Seebeck device, the hot side is held fixed at temperature Th, and 
because of the environment it is in, the cold side remains at temperature Tc. 
Energy is conserved in this system. Thus, the electrical energy extracted 
from the device is given by 

Eout 
= 
kBTh 
 
kBTc. 
(8.38) 

What is the efficiency of this system? Above we assumed that no other 
energy conversion processes occur, so this is an idealized case. The resulting 
efficiency that we calculate represents the best possible efficiency of 
a thermoelectric device operating with sides at temperatures Th 
and Tc. 
Efficiency is defined as 

Eout

eff 
=

Using Eqs. 8.37 and 8.38 and some algebra, we can simplify the efficiency

190 8.7 Thermoelectric Efficiency 

Eq. 8.42 is known as the Carnot efficiency. It provides a serious limitation 
on the efficiency of energy conversion devices which involve converting 
energy of a temperature difference to another form. The Carnot efficiency 
applies to thermoelectric devices, steam turbines, coal power plants, pyroelectric 
devices, and any other energy conversion device that convert a 
temperature difference into another form of energy. It does not, however, 
apply to photovoltaic or piezoelectric devices. If the hot side of a device is 
at the same temperature as the cold side, we cannot extract any energy. If 
the cold side of a device is at room temperature, then the efficiency cannot 
be 100%. The Carnot efficiency represents the best possible efficiency, not 
the actual efficiency of a particular device because it is likely that other 
energy conversion processes occur too. We can extract more energy from a 
steam turbine with Th 
= 
495 
K than Th 
= 
295 
K. However, in both cases, 
the amount of energy we can extract is limited by the Carnot efficiency. 
Note that when using Eq. 8.42, Tc 
and Th 
must be specified on an absolute 
temperature scale, where T 
=0 
is absolute zero. In SI units, we use 
temperature in kelvins. 

As an example, consider a device that converts a temperature difference 
into kinetic energy. The cold side of the device is at room temperature, 
Tc 
= 
300 
K. How hot must the hot side of the device be heated to so that 
the device achieves 40% efficiency?

(8.43)
Th

0:4=1 
 
(8.44)
Th 


According to Eq. 8.42, we find that Th 
= 
500 
K. 

As another example, suppose we want to convert a temperature differential 
to electrical energy using a thermoelectric device. Assume that 
the cold side of the device is at room temperature of Tc 
= 
72 
F and the 
hot side is at human body temperature of Th 
= 
96 
F . What is the best 
possible efficiency? First the temperatures must be converted from degrees 
Fahrenheit to kelvins. The resulting temperatures are Tc 
= 
295 
K and 
Th 
= 
309 
K. Next, using Eq. 8.42, we find the best possible efficiency is 
only 4.5%. 

295 


eff 
=1 
 
=0:045 
(8.45)

As another example, assume that the temperature outside on a December 
day is Tc 
= 
20 
F and inside room temperature is Th 
= 
72 
C. 
What is the Carnot efficiency of a thermoelectric device operating at these 

 
8 THERMOELECTRICS 191 

temperatures? Again we begin by converting the temperatures to kelvins, 
Tc 
= 
266 
K and Th 
= 
295 
K. 


266 


eff 
=1 
 
=0:098 
(8.46)

295 


8.7.2 Other Factors That Affect Efficiency 
The efficiency of practical energy conversion devices is always lower than 
the Carnot efficiency because it is very unlikely that only a single energy 
conversion process occurs. All practical materials, even good conductors, 
have a finite resistance, so energy is converted to thermal energy as charges 
travel through the bulk of the device and through wires connected to it. 
Furthermore, heat flows through the device, so if a heater is connected to 
one side of a device, the other side will be at a higher temperature than 
the room it is in. For this reason, not all energy supplied by the heater can 
be converted to electricity. 

As an example, consider a material with length l 
=1 
mm = 
103 
m 
and cross sectional area A 
=1 
mm2 
= 
106 
m2 
. 
Assume the material has 
a resistivity of ρ 
= 
105 

m which is typical for a moderate conductor. 
Assume a current of I 
=3 
mA flows through the sample. How much power 
is converted to heat due to resistive heating? The electrical conductivity 
of the sample is σ 
=

= 
1051 
The resistance of the device is given by 

ρ

W. (8.47)

A 
106 


While this amount of power may seem small, it is another factor which 
diminishes the efficiency of the device. Even if we convert energy from a 
temperature differential to electricity at the junction of the thermoelectric 
device, some resistive heating occurs. This heat is wasted in the sense that 
it isn't converted back to electricity. 

The efficiency of most thermoelectric devices is less than 10% [5, p. 140] 
[117]. As seen by Eq. 8.42, efficiency depends heavily on the temperatures 
Tc 
and Th, and efficiency can be increased by increasing Th. For many 
devices, the maximum temperature is limited by material considerations 
including the melting temperature. 

 
192 8.8 Applications of Thermoelectrics 

8.8 Applications of Thermoelectrics 
Thermoelectric devices are used to cool electronics, food, and people. Computer 
CPUs, graphics cards, and other types of electronics all generate heat, 
and these components can be damaged by excessive heat. Small thermoelectric 
devices can increase the reliability and lifetime of such components. 
Thermoelectric refrigerators have been used in RVs and submarines 
[3]. These devices are often less efficient than traditional refrigerators, but 
they can be small and quiet and require low maintenance. Some butter and 
cream dispensers in restaurants use thermoelectric devices to keep perishable 
foods cool [118], and truck-sized thermoelectric refrigerators are used 
to keep pharmaceuticals cool [118]. Engineers have tried making air conditioning 
units out of these devices [110]. They are better for the environment 
than traditional air conditioning units which require freon or other chemicals. 
However, they are not often used because the efficiencies are a few 
percent at best [110]. Thermoelectric devices have also been incorporated 
into military clothing to keep soldiers cool [118]. 

Thermoelectric devices are used both to make sensors and to control 
the temperature of sensing circuits. A thermocouple is a small thermoelectric 
device made from a junction of two materials that is used as a 
temperature sensor. It converts a small amount of energy from a temperature 
difference to electricity, and it can be used to measure temperature 
very accurately. Thermocouples are very common and often inexpensive. 
Thermoelectric devices are used to cool scanning electron microscopes and 
other types of imaging devices. Cooling is needed when imaging very small 
objects because heat causes atoms to vibrate, which can smear out microscopic 
images. Liquid nitrogen was used to cool imaging devices before 
thermoelectric devices became available, and it was much less convenient 
to use. The response of many types of sensors depend on temperature. 
A thermoelectric device may be part of a control circuit which keeps the 
sensor at a fixed temperature, so the sensitivity is accurately known. 

Thermoelectric devices are used to generate power for satellites and 
planetary rovers because thermoelectric devices have no moving parts and 
do not require regular refueling. The Mars rover Curiosity is powered 
by NASA's Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator [119]. 
Figure 8.4 illustrates its major components. This power supply contains 
around 10 pounds of plutonium 238 in the form of plutonium dioxide. The 
plutonium decays naturally and produces heat. The heat interacts with a 
thermoelectric device and produces electricity, and the electricity is stored 
in a battery until use. The power supply produces around 2 kW of heat 
and around 120 W of electrical power, so the overall efficiency is around

6% [119]. This technology is not new. The Apollo 12 mission in 1969 used 
a similar type of power supply, but that supply produced only 70 W and 
had a lifetime of 5-8 years. Thermoelectric devices have also been used 
in nuclear power plants as a secondary system to recover some electricity 
from heat produced [5]. 

While thermoelectric effects are often fundamental to the operation of 
sensors and power supplies, the effects are sometimes unwanted [23, p. 457]. 
Electrical circuits contain junctions of wires made out of different metals. 
Such a junction occurs, for example, when an aluminum trace on a printed 
circuit board meets the tin wire of a resistor or when a tin lead solder joint 
meets a copper wire. The Seebeck effect occurs at all of these junctions. 
The Seebeck coefficient at a junction of copper and tin lead solder, for 
example, is 2 V [23, p. 457]. These unwanted voltages that develop can

K 

introduce noise or distortions into sensitive circuits. 

Electrical engineers often think of heat as "wasted energy. Almost 
every electrical circuit contains resistors which heat up when current flows 
through them. In some applications, this heating is the desirable outcome. 

 
194 8.8 Applications of Thermoelectrics 

For example, some train stations have heat lamps for the use in winter, 
and a concert hall on a winter evening fills with people and heats up from 
the bodies. However, usually the heat is just considered a waste product 
or a nuisance. 

In the long time limit, systems will reach an equilibrium temperature, 
but on short time scales, temperature differentials often exist. The inside 
of a car may be at a hotter temperature than the air outside. The air 
near an incandescent light bulb may be hotter than air elsewhere in a 
room, and so on. At one time in the past, we assumed that the earth 
had a nearly infinite amount of petroleum, coal, and other fossil fuels. 
Today, we know that these resources are finite. Recently, there has been 
increased interest in energy harvesting both for environmental reasons and 
for economic reasons, and thermoelectric devices can be used to convert 
this heat to usable electricity.

9.1 Introduction 
This chapter discusses two related energy conversion devices: batteries 
and fuel cells. A battery is a device which converts chemical energy to 
electricity, and one or both of the electrodes of the battery are consumed 
or deposited in the process. A fuel cell is a device which converts chemical 
energy to electricity through the oxidation of a fuel. The fuel, but not the 
electrodes, is consumed in the operation of a fuel cell. Oxidation is the 
process of losing an electron while reduction is the process of gaining an 
electron. Both batteries and fuel cells contain three main components: an 
anode, cathode, and electrolyte. The electrode which electrons flow toward 
is called the cathode. The electrode which electrons flow away from is called 
the anode anode. The electrolyte is a material though which ions can flow 
more easily than electrons. 

In many ways, current technology is limited by battery technology. For 
example, the battery of the Apple iPhone X weighs 42 g and has a specific 
energy of 246 Wh. It accounts for 24 % of the weight of the phone [123] 

kg 
[124]. Similarly, the batteries of the Tesla Model S electric vehicle weigh 

580 kg and have an overall specific energy of 141 Wh. They account for

kg 
27% of the weight of the car [125]. Relatedly, technology companies have 
been rocked by problems in battery manufacture. In July of 2015, more 
than half a million hoverboards produced by ten different companies were 
recalled due to battery explosions [126]. Also, Samsung recalled millions 
of Galaxy Note 7 smart phones in 2016, costing the company billions of 
dollars [127]. The batteries were manufactured by one of two different 
suppliers. Manufacturing issues in batteries produced by both suppliers 
made the phones susceptible to catching on fire [127]. 
Due to the importance of battery technology to the consumer product 
industry, electric vehicle industry, and other technology sectors, money and 
effort have been pouring into battery research, development, and manufacturing. 
Rechargeable lithium ion battery development, in particular, is an 
intense area of effort and investment. All of the examples in the previous 
paragraph involve these lithium batteries. In 2009, $13 billion worth 
of lithium batteries were sold, and 163 billion lithium batteries were produced 
[128, ch. 15]. In 2014 Tesla, one of multiple manufacturers, began 
construction of a new factory named the Gigafactory. Upon completion, 
Tesla aims for this facility to be the largest building in the world and for 
it to annually produce lithium batteries with a combined capacity of 35

gigawatt hours [129]. More recently, industry-wide investment has only 
grown larger. 

9.2 Measures of the Ability of Charges to Flow 
The idea of flow of charges is fundamental to both electrical engineering 
and chemistry. However, electrical engineers and chemists make different 
assumptions, and they use different notations to describe closely related 
phenomena. Engineers prefer to work with solids because solids are durable. 
Electrical engineers assume all discussions involve solids unless otherwise 
specified. Chemists, however, are quite interested in, and assume all discussions 
involve, liquids, with special focus on aqueous solutions. Batteries 
and fuel cells typically involve charge flow through both liquids and solids, 
so to understand these devices, we have to be familiar with notations and 
assumptions from both fields of study. 

In solid conductors, valence electrons flow. Inner shell electrons are 
assumed to be so tightly bound to atoms that their movements can be 
ignored. Nuclei are so much heavier than electrons that their movements 
can also be ignored. In solid semiconductors, both valence electrons and 
holes flow. Electrical engineers measure the ability of charges to flow in 
materials by the electrical conductivity. 

Positive and negative ions can flow more easily in liquids than solids, so 
chemists are concerned with the flow of both electrons and ions. Semiconductor 
physicists tend to use the terms electrical conductivity, resistivity, 
Fermi level, and energy gap. Chemists are so interested in the ability of 
charges to flow that they have many interrelated measures to describe it. 
We'll discuss the following measures: 

• 
Mulliken electronegativity 
• 
Ionization energy 
• 
Electron affinity 
• 
Electronegativity 
• 
Chemical potential 
• 
Chemical hardness 
•

9.2.1 Electrical Conductivity, Fermi Energy Level, and Energy Gap Revisited 
Electrical conductivity σ 
is measured in units 
· 
1 
m, 
and it was discussed in 
Sec. 8.6.2. The inverse is resistivity ρ 
= 
σ 
1 
measured in Ω 
· 
m. 
Electrical 
conductivity and resistivity are measures of the ability of electrons to flow 
through a material. As described by Eq. 8.32, electrical conductivity is 
directly proportional to the number of charges present and the mobility of 
the charges. Conductors have large electrical conductivity, and insulators 
have small electrical conductivity. These measures can describe liquids and 
gases as well as solids. Also, gases, liquids, and solids can all be classified 
as conductors, dielectrics, or semiconductors. 

Fermi energy level, energy gap, valence band, and conduction band 
were defined in Section 6.3. The left part of Fig. 9.1 shows an energy level 
diagram zoomed in so that only some levels are shown, and these terms 
are illustrated in the figure. At T 
=0 
K, energy levels are filled up to 
some level called the valence band. The energy level above it, which is 
unfilled or partially unfilled, is called the conduction band. The amount of 
energy needed to completely remove an electron from the valence band is 
represented by the vertical distance from that energy level to the ground 
state, labeled 0 eV, at the top of the figure. The energy gap, Eg, is the 
vertical distance between the valence and conduction bands. It represents 
the minimum amount of energy needed to excite an electron. The Fermi 

 
204 9.2 Measures of the Ability of Charges to Flow 

energy level represents the energy level at which the probability of finding 
an electron is 0.5. At T 
=0 
K, it is at the middle of the energy gap. 
In the figure, it is shown as a dotted line. Qualitatively, it represents 
the amount of energy needed to remove the next electron. No electrons 
have exactly that energy because there are no allowed states in the gap. 
For a doped semiconductor, a semiconductor with crystalline defects, or 
a semiconductor not at absolute zero temperature, the Fermi level is near 
but not quite at the middle of the gap. 

The right part of the figure shows the same energy level diagram labeled 
using terms more commonly used by chemists to describe isolated 
atoms than by physicists to describe solid semiconductors. Chemists sometimes 
use the term highest occupied energy level instead of valence band. 
This term is most often used to refer to energy levels of isolated atoms or 
molecules because some authors reserve the term band for an energy level 
shared between neighboring atoms. Similarly, chemists sometimes use the 
term lowest unoccupied energy level in place of conduction band. As discussed 
below in Secs. 9.2.3 and 9.2.4, the term chemical potential chem 
is used in place of Fermi energy level Ef 
, and the energy gap Eg 
may be 
called twice the chemical hardness. 

9.2.2 Mulliken Electronegativity 
One measure that chemists use to describe the ability of charges to flow is 
electronegativity, and this term has multiple definitions in the literature. 
One definition is by Mulliken in 1934 [130], and this measure will be referred 
to as the Mulliken electronegativity. Mulliken approximated the energy in 
a chemical bond by averaging the ionization energy Iioniz 
and the electron 
affinity Aaff 
. Mulliken electronegativity is defined 

Iioniz 
+ 
Aaff 


Mulliken 
= 
. 
(9.1)

2 


Ionization energy is the energy needed to remove an electron from an atom 
or ion, and electron affinity is the energy change when an electron is added 
to an atom or ion [12]. All of these quantities, Mulliken;Iioniz, 
and Aaff 
, 

J

are measured in the SI units of atom or occasionally in other units like 
eV kJ 

atom or mol. 


This definition is simpler than other definitions of electronegativity, and 
reference [131] calls this an "operational and approximate definition. It is 
useful because it involves strength of chemical bonds, and we can relate it to 
the measures used by semiconductor researchers. Qualitatively, ionization 
energy is represented by the energy needed to rip off an electron. In Fig. 

 
9 BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS 205 

9.1, it is the vertical distance from the valence band or highest occupied 
state to the ground state at the top of the figure. Sometimes chemists 
call this amount of energy the work function instead [60, ch. 6] [108]. In 
Fig. 9.1, the electron affinity is represented by the vertical distance from 
the conduction band or lowest unoccupied state to the ground state at the 
top of the figure. The magnitude of the Mulliken electronegativity is the 
average of these two energies, so it is the magnitude of the Fermi energy 
at T 
=0 
K. 
By convention, it has the opposite sign.

Fundamentally, electrical engineering is the study of flow of charges. 
Chemistry is the study of the strength of chemical bonds. The electrical 
conductivity of a material is high when the chemical bonds holding that 
material together are easily broken so that many free charges can flow. 
The electrical conductivity of a material is low when chemical bonds holding 
atoms together require lots of energy to break. Electronegativity is a 
measure of the energy required to break chemical bonds, so fundamentally, 
it tells us similar information to electrical conductivity. 

9.2.3 Chemical Potential and Electronegativity 
Another way of defining electronegativity follows the definition introduced 
by Pritchard in 1956 [132]. This definition is one of the more common ones, 
and it is used by both chemists [131] [133] and by other scientists [2, p. 
124.]. The electronegativity of an atom is defined as 

 

@U 


χ 
= 
 
(9.3)

@N 


V;S, 


where U 
is the internal energy relative to a neutral atom and N 
represents 
the number of electrons around the atom. An atom is composed of a 
charged nucleus and charged electrons moving around the nucleus, so there 
is an electric field, and hence an electrical potential V 
in volts, around 
an atom. This potential significantly depends on the number of electrons 
around the atom. Also, when the atom is at a temperature above absolute 
zero, the electrons and nuclei are in motion, so the atom has some 
entropy S. Electronegativity involves @U 
at constant electrical potential 

@N 


and entropy. It applies whether the atoms are part of a solid, liquid, or 
gas. 
The chemical potential chem 
is defined as the negative of this electronegativity. 
chem 
= 
χ 
(9.4) 

 
206 9.2 Measures of the Ability of Charges to Flow 

In SI units, both chemical potential and electronegativity are measured 
J eV kJ

in atom, but sometimes they are also expressed in or As if

atom mol. 


the three names, chemical potential, negative of the electronegativity, and 
Fermi energy level, weren't enough, this quantity is also known as the 
partial molar free energy [60, p. 145]. 

Electronegativity is used to describe a collection of atoms, molecules, 
or ions all of the same ionization state [131]. Less energy is required to 
rip the first electron off an atom than the second or third electron. The 
definition of electronegativity is specific to potential V 
, in volts, due to the 
nucleus and electrons around an atom. For example, we can talk about 
the electronegativity, energy required to rip off the electron, of a neutral 
magnesium atom. We can also talk about the electronegativity, energy 
required to rip off an electron, from a Mg+ 
ion. The electric field, and 
hence potential V 
, around a neutral Mg atom and the electric field, and 
hence potential V 
, around a magnesium ion Mg+ 
are necessarily different 
because of the number of electrons present. The energies required to rip 
off the next electron from these atoms will also necessarily be different. 
So, electronegativity of a material always refers to a specific ionization 
state. Electronegativity incorporates both the energy required or gained 
by ripping off an electron and the energy required or gained by acquiring an 
electron. Qualitatively, it is the average of the ionization energy required 
to rip off an electron and the electron affinity released when an electron 
is captured. In the case of the Mg atom from the example above, the 
energy gained by releasing an electron is the significant term, but that is 
not always the case. 

In most energy conversion devices, and most chemical reactions, we are 
interested in only the valence electrons. So, even if an atom has dozens 
of electrons around it and the energy to rip off each electron is different, 
we are just interested in the first few valence electrons. We will see that 
batteries and fuel cells involve energy stored in chemical bonds. Only 
the valence electrons are involved in the reactions of batteries and fuel 
cells, so in studying batteries and fuel cells, we are most interested in the 
electronegativity of neutral or singly ionized atoms. 

Equation 9.3 defines electronegativity as the energy required to rip off 
the next electron from the atom. Again consider Fig. 9.1. The energy level 
known as the valence band to semiconductor physicists and the highest 
occupied state to chemists is filled with electrons. The next highest band, 
called either the conduction band by semiconductor physicists or lowest 
unoccupied state by chemists, is not filled with electrons. The electronegativity 
according to this definition is the energy required to rip off the next 
electron. On average, it is again graphically represented by the Fermi level. 

 
9 BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS 207 

Both electronegativity defined by Eq. 9.3 and Mulliken electronegativity 
defined by Eq. 9.1 have the same units. However, multiple other 
definitions of electronegativity can be found in the literature. One of the 
oldest definitions is due to Pauling in 1932 [134], and that definition is 
measured instead in the units of square root of joules on a relative scale. 
Reference [135] expanded on Pauling's definition to show variation with 
ionization state and atom radius. Reference [133] also contains a different 
definition of electronegativity also with its own units. 

9.2.4 Chemical Hardness 
Chemists sometimes use the term hardness when semiconductor physicists 
would use the term half the energy gap. Chemical hardness has nothing to 
do with mechanical hardness. As with electronegativity, there are multiple 
related definitions of hardness. The Mulliken hardness is defined as [131] 

Iioniz 
 
Aaff 


Mulliken hardness = 
. 
(9.5)

2 


A more careful definition of chemical hardness is [131] [136, p. 93] 

 

1 
@chem

hardness = 
. 
(9.6)

2 
@N 


V;S, 


It is half the change in chemical potential for the next electron, and qualitatively 
it is represented by half the energy gap. As with electronegativity, 
it is specified for a given potential in volts around the atom and a given 
entropy. Liquids may be classified as hard or soft. Hard acids and hard 
bases have large energy gaps, so they are electrical insulators. Soft acids 
and soft bases have small energy gaps, so they are electrical conductors. No 
additional variable will be introduced for hardness because this quantity 
can be represented by half the energy gap, E 
2 
g 
. 

9.2.5 Redox Potential 
Redox (from REDuction-OXidation) potential Vrp 
is yet another measure 
used by chemists to describe the ability of electrons to be ripped off their 
atoms and flow in the presence of an applied voltage, nearby chemical, optical 
field, or other energy source. As defined above, the process of ripping 
off electrons is called oxidation. The process of gaining electrons is called 
reduction. Together, they form redox reactions. Instead of being measured 
in joules like electronegativity, it is measured in volts where a volt is a joule 
per coulomb. Redox potential represents the energy stored in a chemical 

 
208 9.2 Measures of the Ability of Charges to Flow 

bond per unit charge. It is more often used by experimentalists than theorists, 
and it is often used to describe solids instead of liquids. Redox 
potential is a macroscopic property, describing a larger piece of material as 
opposed to describing just an individual atom. It is also sometimes called 
oxidation reduction potential or the standard electrode potential [137]. It 
is a relative measure of the ability of a substance to lose an electron. A 
list of redox potentials can be found in references [60, p. 158] and [137]. 
There are different ways of defining redox potential in the literature. The 
definitions vary in their choice of a ground reference voltage, and they vary 
in their sign conventions. American and European researchers tend to use 
different definitions. 

Redox potential is measured on a relative scale. To measure redox 
potential [138], electrodes are put in the system being studied. A potential 
is applied to balance the internal voltage. By measuring this externally 
applied voltage, the potential of an electrode is determined with respect 
to a reference electrode. Often, the potential of a platinum electrode is 
used as a reference and said to have zero volts at standard conditions of 
T 
= 
25 
0C and P 
=1 
atm. The reaction at the platinum electrode is 

H2 
 
2H+ 
+2e 
 
. 
(9.7) 

9.2.6 pH 
pH is a unitless measure of the likelihood that a water molecule is bonded 
or has been ionized in a liquid solution. It is used to classify liquids as 
acidic or basic. When discussing pH, we assume the material under test is 
a liquid solution at a temperature of 25 
C and a pressure of 1 atm [12] 
[81]. A liquid solution is a mixture of water and another material called a 
solute. More specifically, pH is defined as 

! 

pH = 
log10

 .

The quantity H+

units of mol [68, p. 39].

This quantity was formerly called molarity or molar concentration, but 
these terms are no longer recommended for use [68, p. 39]. pH is a measure 
often used by experimentalists. 

 
9 BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS 209 

The concept of pH is fundamentally related to the flow of charges, a 
concept which is very important to electrical engineers. Water is composed 
of H2O molecules. In pure water, some of these molecules fall apart, ionizing 
into H+ 
ions (protons) and OH 
ions. However, most of the molecules 
remain intact. If some solutes are mixed with the water, more of the H2O 
molecules will ionize than in pure water. For example, carbon dioxide will 
bond with OH 
ions forming carbonic acid HCO 
3 
causing an increase in 
H+ 
ions. Since pH is the negative log of H+ 
ion activity, increasing H+ 
ion 
concentration is equivalent to a pH decrease. If ammonia, NH3, is added to 
water, NH+
4 
is formed, and the number of OH 
ions increases resulting in 
an increase in pH. Since water is a liquid, both these positive and negative 
ion charge carriers can move about relatively easily. If an external voltage 
is applied across the liquid, ions will flow. Electrical conductivity will be 
higher in a liquid with more ions present than in liquids with fewer ions 
present. 

As an example, consider what happens when neutral sodium atoms are 
added to water. (For obvious reasons, don't try this at home [139].) It is 
energetically favorable for the sodium atoms to ionize to Na+ 
giving up an 
electron. In the process, some more water molecules ionize, and some H+ 
ions become neutral H atoms.

By adding the solute sodium, the solution has fewer H+

Consider what happens when neutral chlorine atoms are added to water.

form Cl 
ion.

By adding the solute chlorine, the solution has more H+ 
ions. While these 
examples involve adding neutral atoms, the concept of pH applies to solutes 
which are molecules too. 

Solutions with pH less than 7 are called acidic. If a solution has a high 
concentration of H+ 
ions, it will have a low pH and be acidic. In strongly 
acidic solutions, molecules of the solute rip apart many water molecules, 
so lots of ions are present. Solutions with pH greater than 7 are called 
alkaline or basic. If a solution has a low concentration of H+ 
ions, and 
hence a high concentration of OH 
ions, it will have a high pH and be 
alkaline. In strongly alkaline solutions, molecules of the solute rip apart 
many water molecules, so again lots of ions are present. Neutral solutions 
have a pH near 7, and some neutral solutions may be electrical insulators. 
Solutions with a pH much below or much above 7 necessarily have many 
ions present, and they are good electrical conductors. 

 
210 9.2 Measures of the Ability of Charges to Flow 

As an example, let's find the pH of a solution with 1015 
ions of H+

9.3 Charge Flow in Batteries and Fuel Cells 
9.3.1 Battery Components 
The flow of both positive and negative charges must be considered to understand 
the operations of batteries and fuel cells. The simplest battery 
contains just an anode, cathode, and electrolyte. These components are 
illustrated in Fig. 9.2. 

AnodeCathode-+
ElectrolyteSeparatorLoadSeal
Figure 9.2: Battery components. 

Both of the electrodes must be good conductors. They are often porous 
to increase the surface area where the reaction occurs. The cathode is a 
sink for electrons and positive ions, and both of these types of charges are 
attracted towards this terminal. The cathode is the positive electrode of 
a discharging battery. The anode is source for electrons and positive ions, 
and both of these types of charges flow away from the anode. The anode 
is the negative electrode of a discharging battery. 

The electrolyte has high ionic conductivity but low electrical conductivity. 
For this reason, during discharge of a battery, ions flow from the anode 
to the cathode through the electrolyte. Meanwhile, electrons are forced 
to flow from the anode to the cathode through the load. The electrolyte 
is often a liquid but sometimes a thin solid. Batteries are contained in a 
package. If the electrolyte is liquid, a seal is included to prevent it from 
spilling or escaping [140]. 

Most batteries also contain a separator, which is typically made from 
a thin polymer membrane [140]. The separator allows some but not other 
ions to flow through, and it is a physical barrier that prevents the electrodes 
from contacting and shorting out the battery.

Additional components are often added to improve device safety, and 
Table 9.1 lists some of these optional components. A user may mistakenly 
insert a battery backwards. To prevent damage due to this error, some batteries 
incorporate a diode [128, ch. 5.1]. The voltage across the terminals 
of a battery with an internal diode will necessarily be less than the voltage 
across an equivalent battery without the diode present. Other batteries, 
like typical 9V batteries, incorporate connectors that can only be attached 
one way. A battery may also be damaged if the terminals are shorted. 
Most batteries include vents so gases can safely escape when a battery is 
damaged due to shorting the terminals, attempting too much current draw, 
or overheating for other reasons [128, ch. 5.1]. Some batteries include a 
fuse or circuit breaker in the package to prevent damage in these cases too. 
Additionally, rechargeable batteries can be damaged if the recharging process 
is not properly controlled [128, ch. 5.1]. Some rechargeable batteries 
have a thermocouple and microcontroller built into the package to control 
the recharging process and prevent overheating during recharging [128, ch. 
5.1]. Users should not try to recharge nonrechargeable batteries. While the 
chemical reaction can often go in either direction, the package and structure 
of a primary battery are not designed to withstand the charging process 
and will typically be damaged [128, ch. 5.1]. 

9.3.2 Charge Flow in a Discharging Battery 
As a battery discharges, chemical energy stored in the bonds holding together 
the electrodes is converted to electrical energy in the form of current 
flowing through the load. Consider an example battery with a magnesium 
anode and a nickel oxide cathode. The reaction at the anode is given by

This reaction occurs in alkaline solutions that contain OH 
ions available 
to react, so an electrolyte such as potassium hydroxide, KOH, can be used 
[140]. Other reactions may simultaneously occur at these electrodes [137], 
but for simplicity these other reactions will be ignored. 

Figure 9.3 illustrates the charge flow in the battery during normal operation. 
A complete circuit is formed not just by the flow of electrons but by 
a combination of the flow of electrons and ions [128]. Electrons flow away 
from the negative terminal (anode) through the load. Negative OH 
ions 
flow away from the positive terminal (cathode) through the electrolyte. 
The separator should allow the OH 
to flow from the positive terminal to 
the negative terminal. For some electrodes, though not in this example, 
positive ions, instead of negative ions, complete the circuit by flowing away 
from the negative terminal. As shown in the figure, the direction of current 
flow is opposite to the direction of electron flow. The battery continues to 
discharge until one of the electrodes is used up [3, p. 226]. 

9.3.3 Charge Flow in a Charging Battery 
Figure 9.4 illustrates the flow of charges when the battery is charging. During 
charging, energy is converted from electrical energy due to the external 
voltage source back to chemical energy stored in the chemical bonds holding 
together the electrodes. Again, the flow of both electrons and ions, not 
just electrons, must be considered. As above, the direction of the current

is the opposite of the direction of the flow of electrons. Reactions occurring 
are the opposite of the reactions given by Eqs. 9.19 and 9.20. By definition, 
the cathode is the electrode which electrons flow towards, and the anode 
is the electrode which electrons flow away from. During charging, unlike 
during discharging, the cathode is the negative terminal and the anode is 
the positive terminal. For this example, the reaction at the cathode is 

Mg(OH)2 
+2e 
 
 
Mg +2OH 
(9.21) 

and the reaction at the anode is 

Ni(OH)2 
+2OH 
 
NiO2 
+2H2O +2e 
 
. 
(9.22) 

In this example, OH 
ions flow away from the cathode during charging. 
However, in some reactions, both the flow of negative ions away from the 
cathode and positive ions away from the anode must be considered during 
charging. 

9.3.4 Charge Flow in Fuel Cells 
A fuel cell contains many of the same components as a battery [3, p. 226] 
[128, p. 376] [141]. Like a battery, a fuel cell contains an anode and a 
cathode. These electrodes must be good conductors, and they are often 
porous so that they have a large surface area. Electrodes are in a liquid 
or solid electrolyte through which ions can flow. The electrodes are often 
coated in a catalyst, such as platinum, to speed up chemical reactions 
[141]. A fuel cell contains a separator, typically called a membrane, which 
selectively allows ions to flow. As with the separator of a battery, it is

Figure 9.5: Charge flow in a fuel cell. 

typically made from a thin polymer. Fuel is added at the anode, and an 
oxidizer is added at the cathode. Typically, both the fuel and oxidizer 
are liquids or gases. They get consumed during operation while the anode 
and cathode are not consumed as they are in a discharging battery. These 
components are illustrated in Fig. 9.5. 

As an example, a fuel cell may use H2 
gas as the fuel and O2 
gas as the 
oxidizer. The anode may be carbon cloth [141], and this reaction is sped 
up by a platinum catalyst [108]. An alkaline solution such as KOH can be 
the electrolyte. For this fuel in an alkaline electrolyte, the reaction at the 
anode is 

H2 
+2OH 
 
2H2O +2e 
 
(9.23) 

and the reaction at the cathode is

[108]. 

Figure 9.5 also illustrates charge flow in an example fuel cell [3, p. 226] 
[128, p. 376] [141]. Oxidation, the process of ripping electrons off the fuel 
leaving positive ions, occurs at the anode. These electrons flow from the 
anode to the cathode through the load. At the cathode, the oxidizer is 
reduced. In other words, at the cathode, the oxidizer reacts incorporating 
these electrons to form negative ions. These negative ions flow from the 
cathode to the anode, and positive ions flow from the anode to the cathode. 
The membrane prevents charges from flowing in the reverse direction, and 
it prevents the positive ions and negative ions from combining with each

other directly. A fuel cell can continue to operate as long as the fuel and 
oxidizer are added and the oxidation products are removed. 

9.4 Measures of Batteries and Fuel Cells 
9.4.1 Cell Voltage, Specific Energy, and Related Measures 
Just as chemists have multiple measures of the ability of charges to flow, 
they have multiple measures of energy or charge stored in a device. In this 
section, the following measures of batteries and fuel cells are defined: 

• 
Cell voltage in volts 
• 
Specific energy in J or Wh 
g kg 

JWh

• 
Energy density in m3 
or 
L 

• 
Capacity in mAh or C 
• 
Specific capacity in mAhor C 
g kg 

• 
Charge density in mAL h or CL 
Definitions throughout this section follow references [128, ch. 1] and [140]. 

If these measures are calculated using knowledge of chemical reactions 
and quantities found in the periodic table, they are called theoretical values. 
If these quantities are experimentally measured, they are called practical 
values. Practical values are necessarily less because no energy conversion 
device is ever completely efficient. Measures preceded by the word specific 
are given per unit mass. Measures followed by the word density are give 
per unit volume. For example, specific energy is measured in the SI units 
of joules per gram and energy density is measured in the SI units of joules 
per meter cubed. However, these rules are not closely followed, so the term 
energy density is sometimes used to mean energy per unit weight instead 
of per unit volume. It is safest to explicitly specify the units of measure to 
avoid this confusion. 

Theoretical cell voltage, Vcell 
measured in volts, is the voltage between 
the anode and the cathode in a battery or fuel cell. It is the sum of the 
redox potential for the half reaction at the anode and the redox potential 
for the half reaction at the cathode. It represents the voltage between the 
terminals of a completely charged battery or fuel cell. Many authors call 
this measure theoretical cell potential instead of cell voltage, and symbols 

 
9 BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS 217 

E0 
or 0 
are also used in the literature. As discussed in Appendix C, the 
word potential is overloaded with multiple meanings. The word voltage 
and the symbol Vcell 
are used here to emphasize that this quantity is essentially 
voltage. Since redox potentials for many half reactions are tabulated 
[128, app. B] [137], theoretical cell voltage can be quickly calculated for 
many reactions. While we can calculate the theoretical cell voltage, we can 
measure the practical cell voltage with a voltmeter. The theoretical cell 
voltage will always be slightly larger than the practical cell voltage because 
the theoretical cell voltage ignores a number of effects including internal 
resistance and other factors discussed in the next section. Reactions with 
Vcell 
> 
0 
occur spontaneously [12, ch. 18]. 

Three related measures are capacity, specific capacity, and charge density. 
Capacity is measured in ampere hours or coulombs. (By definition, 
one ampere is equal to one coulomb per second.) It is a measure of the 
charge stored in a battery or fuel cell. Specific capacity is a measure of 

C

the charge stored per unit mass. It is specified in mAh, kg , or related

g 
units. Charge density is a measure of the charge stored per unit volume, 
C

and it is specified in mAh, m3 
, or related units. While capacity depends 

L 

on the amount of material present, specific capacity and charge density do 
not. All of these measures may be specified as theoretical values calculated 
from knowledge of the chemical reactions involved or practical values 
measured experimentally where the theoretical values are always slightly 
higher. Also for all of these values, only valence electrons are considered. 
Batteries and fuel cells necessarily have more electrons than are included 
in these measures because inner shell electrons, which do not participate in 
the chemical reaction, are ignored. Energy is stored in the bonds holding 
inner shell electrons, but this energy is not converted to electricity in batteries 
or fuel cells. The concept of charge density, ch 
in units mC 
3 
, was first 
introduced in section 1.6.1, and it shows up in Gauss's law, one of Maxwell's 
equations. However, the word capacity has nothing to do with the word 
capacitance introduced earlier. See Appendix C for more information on 
this and other overloaded terms. 

Wh

Theoretical specific energy is measured in Jg , kg , or related units 

[128, ch. 1]. It is a measure of the energy stored in a battery or fuel 
cell per unit weight. It is the product of the theoretical cell voltage and 
the specific charge. Relatedly, theoretical energy density, measured in mJ 
3 


Wh

or , is a measure of the energy stored in a device per unit volume. 

L 

Theoretical energy density is the product of theoretical cell voltage and 
charge density. These measures can be calculated from knowledge of the 

 
218 9.4 Measures of Batteries and Fuel Cells 

chemical reactions involved using information found in the periodic table. 
Practical specific energy and practical energy density are typically 25-35% 
below the theoretical values [128, ch. 1.5]. Specific energy and energy 
density are important measures of a battery. Often, high values are desired 
so that small and light batteries can be used to power devices for as long 
as possible. However, as specific energy and energy density increase, safety 
considerations increase.

constant. It has the value

[68]. This quantity will not be used below because the Avogadro constant 
Na 
and the magnitude of the charge of an electron q 
are already specified 
and because this text already has too many variables. 

We can calculate the theoretical specific capacity in Ag h and the the


oretical specific energy in Jg for the reactions given by Eq. 9.19 and 9.20. 
The redox potential for the Mg half reaction is Vrp

potential for the Ni half reaction is Vrp

(9.26) 

The reaction occurs spontaneously when it is set up because Vcell

0. 

By unit conversions, we can calculate the weight per unit charge for 
each half reaction. From the periodic table, the atomic weight of Mg is 

gg

24.31 mol, the atomic weight of Ni is 58.69 mol, and the atomic weight 
g
of O is 16.00 First consider the Mg half reaction of Eq. 9.19 which

In the calculation above, only the electrode weights were considered. However,

9.4.2 Practical Voltage and Efficiency 
We can model both a battery and a fuel cell as an ideal voltage source. This 
is a useful model, but at times, it is not good enough for multiple reasons. 
A better model includes some internal resistance [128, p. 9.27]. However, 
even this model is inadequate because the voltage of any practical battery 
depends on temperature, the load, the current through the battery, the 
fraction of capacity used, the number of times it has been recharged, and 
other factors [128, p. 3.2]. An even better model includes these variations 
too, as shown in Fig. 9.6.

Figure 9.6: Models of a battery. 

There are many measures used to describe the voltage across a battery 
or fuel cell. The nominal voltage is the typical voltage during use, and it 

 
220 9.4 Measures of Batteries and Fuel Cells 

is often the voltage printed on the label. The end or cutoff voltage is the 
voltage at the end of the battery's useful life. The open circuit voltage is 
the voltage under no load, and it is approximately the initial voltage of the 
battery. The closed circuit voltage is the voltage under load. It is less than 
the open circuit voltage due to the internal resistance of the battery [128, 
p. 3.2]. 

All batteries and fuel cells have some internal resistance. The cathode 
and anode are made of metals which are good, but imperfect, conductors. 
For example, carbon is a common electrode material, and it has an electrical 
conductivity between 1:6 
· 
104 
and 2:0 
· 
107

· 
1 
m [106]. Anytime current 
flows through a physical material with finite electrical conductivity, energy 
is converted to heat. Actual voltage is a function of current drawn from 
the battery because at high currents, this effect is larger. Also, the actual 
voltage is a function of temperature because ions move faster at higher 
temperatures, so there is less internal resistance at higher temperatures 
[128, p. 3.9]. However, at higher temperatures, chemical reactions may 
occur more quickly, so the life of the batteries may be less because reactions 
occur faster. 

The actual voltage across a battery or fuel cell is also influenced by the 
accumulation of chemical reaction products. In the example given by Eqs. 

9.19 and 9.20, the reactants were Mg and NiO2 
and the reaction products 
were Mg(OH)2 
and Ni(OH)2. The actual voltage across the device decays 
with use because reactants build up in the electrolyte as the reaction occurs. 
These reactants inhibit further reactions from taking place [128, p. 3.2]. 
The effect of the accumulation of products on the voltage of a battery 
can be modeled by

which is known as the Nernst equation [12, p. 750,789]. Many authors replace 
the Boltzmann constant in this expression using R 
= 
NakB 
where Na 
is the Avogadro constant and R 
is the molar gas constant. In this expression, 
Vcell 
theor 
is the theoretical cell voltage, and Vcell 
prac 
is the practical 
cell voltage that incorporates the effect of reaction products. The quantity 
Nv 
represents the number of valence electrons involved in the chemical reaction. 
For the example of Eqs. 9.19 and 9.20, two electrons are involved. 
So, the quantity k

present, and 

 

[products]

(9.35)

[reactants] 


In this case, the activity quotient is very small, so the practical cell voltage 
between the terminals is very close to the theoretical cell voltage. After a 
battery has been discharging for a long time, the activity quotient is large 
because many products are present. 

 

[products]

ln 
≈

(9.36)

[reactants] 


As expected, this model shows that as a battery discharges, the difference 
between the theoretical and practical cell voltage grows. We cannot ever 
use the entire capacity stored in a battery. As the battery discharges, the 
voltage between the terminals drops. At some point, the voltage level is 
too low to be useful, and the end voltage is reached. At this point, the 
battery should be replaced even though it still has some stored charge. 

The Nernst equation is useful to chemists because it can be used to 
solve for the amount concentration of reaction products and reactants. 
The theoretical cell voltage can be calculated or found in a table, and the 
practical cell voltage can be measured with a voltmeter. Reference [137] 
tabulates components of the activity quotient as a function of temperature 
for various reactions. 

Electrical engineers may be more interested in the Nernst equation because 
it gives information on the efficiency of batteries and fuel cells. Efficiency 
is defined as the output power over the input power or the output 
energy over the input energy.

Equation 9.47 shows that the efficiency is a function of the activity quotient. 
As described above, the activity quotient is different for different reactions, 
and it varies with temperature. The activity quotient is a measure of the 
effect of the accumulation of products in the electrolyte of a battery or fuel 
cell. 
Equation 9.47 describes the efficiency of batteries and fuel cells. It is 
another way of expressing the Nernst equation. It is analogous to equations 
we have encountered describing efficiency of other energy conversion 

 
9 BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS 223 

devices. More specifically, it has a similar form to the equation for the 
Carnot efficiency, Eq. 8.42. Carnot efficiency describes the temperature 
dependence of the efficiency of all devices which convert a temperature 
difference to another form of energy. It was introduced in the context of 
thermoelectric devices, but it applies to pyroelectric devices, steam turbines, 
and other devices too. These equations also have a similar form 
to Eq. 7.23 which modeled the effect of mirror reflectivity and optical 
absorption on the efficiency of a laser. 

9.5 Battery Types 
9.5.1 Battery Variety 
An ideal battery has many desirable qualities. It should: 

• 
have high specific energy and energy density 
• 
contain no toxic chemicals so that it is environmentally friendly and 
easy to dispose of safely 
• 
be safe to use 
• 
be inexpensive 
• 
be rechargeable 
• 
require no complicated procedure to recharge 
• 
be able to output large current 
• 
be able to withstand a wide range of temperatures 
• 
produce a constant voltage output throughout its life (have a flat 
discharge curve) 
• 
remain charged for a long time while in storage 
The list above is not complete, and it is in no particular order. Tradeoffs 
are needed because many of these qualities inherently contradict. For example, 
a device with a high specific energy necessarily requires more safety 
precautions and controlled use than a device with low specific energy. 

Batteries are used in a wide range of applications, so one type is not best 
in all situations. As an example, a car ignition battery must be rechargeable, 
have high capacity, output large current, and operate over a wide 
temperature range. However, car batteries do not require particularly high 

 
224 9.5 Battery Types 

specific energies. As another example, tiny batteries are used to power 
microelectromechanical systems such as micropumps [142] [143]. These 
batteries must have high specific energy and be able to be produced in 
small packages. Some are even built into integrated circuits [144] [145]. 

One way to classify batteries is as primary or secondary. A primary 
battery is used once, then disposed. A secondary battery is a rechargeable 
battery. Primary batteries have the advantage of simplicity [128, ch. 8]. 
They do not require maintenance, so they are simple to use. Also, their 
construction may be simpler than secondary batteries because they do not 
need additional circuitry built in to monitor or control the recharging process. 
They often have high specific energy too [128, ch. 8]. They come 
in a variety of sizes and shapes, and they are made with a variety of electrode 
and electrolyte materials. Many alkaline and lithium ion batteries 
are designed to be primary batteries. Secondary batteries have the obvious 
advantage of not producing as much waste that ends up in a landfill. 
Also, the user does not need to continually purchase replacements. While 
secondary batteries may cost more initially, they can be cheaper in long 
run. They are often designed to be recharged thousands of times [128, ch. 
15]. Many secondary batteries have a very flat discharge curve, so they 
produce a constant voltage throughout use, even upon multiple charging 
cycles [128, ch. 15]. Two of the most common types of secondary batteries 
are lead acid batteries and lithium batteries. 

There are many battery types, distinguished by choice of electrolyte 
and electrodes. Four common battery types are discussed in this section: 
lead acid, alkaline, nickel metal hydride, and lithium. Not all batteries 
fit into one of these families. Some devices, like zinc air batteries, are 
even harder to categorize. Zinc air batteries are actually battery fuel cell 
hybrids because the zinc of the anode is consumed as in battery operation 
while oxygen from air is consumed as in fuel cell operation. However, by 
considering these four classes, we will see some of the variety available. For 
a more thorough and encyclopedic discussion of battery types, see reference 
[128]. 

Table 9.2 summarizes example batteries of each of these four types. The 
first three rows list example materials used to make the anode, cathode, 
and electrolyte for batteries. Materials listed in the table are just examples, 
so batteries of each type can be made with a variety of other materials too. 
The next two rows give approximate values for the specific energy in units of 

Wh

All values are approximate values for representative devices provided

particular device. The fifth row lists example values for the theoretical

9.5.2 Lead Acid 
Lead acid batteries are secondary batteries which typically have an anode 
of Pb and a cathode of PbO2 
[128, ch. 15]. The electrolyte is a liquid 
solution of the acid H2SO4 
which ionizes into 2H+ 
and SO24 
 
. 
The reaction

at the anode is 
Pb+SO24 
 
 
PbSO4

(9.48) 

with a redox potential of Vrp 
=0:37 
V [140]. The reaction at the cathode 
is

SO24 
 
+4H+ 
+2e 
 
 
PbSO4 
+2H2O (9.49) 

with a redox potential of Vrp 
=1:685 
V [140]. The overall cell voltage is 
Vcell 
=2:055 
V, so in a car battery, six cells are packaged in series. 

Lead acid batteries have a long history. The development of the battery 
dates to the work of Volta around 1795 [3, p. 2], and practical lead acid 
batteries were first developed around 1860 by Raymond Gaston Planté 
[128, p. 16.1.1]. Today, lead acid batteries are used to start the ignition 
system in cars and trucks, used as stationary backup power systems, and 
used in other applications requiring large capacity and large output current. 
Typically, lead acid batteries can handle relatively high current, and they 
operate well over a wide temperature range [128, p. 15.2]. Additionally, 
they have a flat discharge curve [128, p. 15.2]. Other types of batteries have 
a higher energy density and specific energy, so lead acid batteries are used 
in situations where specific energy is less of a concern than other factors. 

9.5.3 Alkaline 
Alkaline batteries typically have a zinc anode and a manganese dioxide 
MnO2 
cathode [128, p. 8.10]. Figure 9.7 shows naturally occurring manganese 
dioxide (the dark mineral) on feldspar (the white mineral) from 
Ruggles mine near Grafton, New Hampshire. The batteries are called alkaline 
due to the use of an alkaline electrolyte, typically a liquid potassium 
hydroxide KOH solution [128, p. 8.10]. Most alkaline batteries are primary 
batteries, but some secondary alkaline batteries are available. Alkaline batteries 
have many nice properties. They can handle high current outputs, 
they are inexpensive, and they operate well over a wide temperature range 
[128, p. 8.10]. One limitation, though, is that they have a sloping discharge 
curve [128, p. 8.10]. Alkaline batteries were originally developed for military 
applications during WWII [128, ch. 8]. They became commercially 
available in 1959, and they became popular in the 1980s with improvements 
in their quality [128, p.11.1]. They are commonly used today in inexpensive 
electronics, toys, and gadgets.

9.5.4 Nickel Metal Hydride 
Nickel metal hydride batteries have an anode made from a nickel metal alloy 
saturated with hydrogen. One example alloy used is LaNi5 
[146]. Another 
rare earth atom may replace the lanthanum [146], and other alloys like 
TiNi2 
or ZrNi2 
saturated with hydrogen are also used as anode materials 
[146]. The cathode is typically made from a nickel oxide, and the electrolyte 
is potassium hydroxide, KOH [128, p. 15.11]. The reaction at the anode is 
[146] 

Alloy(H) +

and the reaction at the cathode is [146]

Ni(OH)2 
+ 
OH 
. 
(9.51) 

This cathode reaction has a redox potential of Vrp 
=0:52 
V [137]. 

Nickel metal hydride batteries have many advantages. They have a flat 
discharge curve. They are secondary batteries which can be charged reliably 
many times [128, p. 15.1] [147]. Additionally, they are better for the 
environment than the related nickel cadmium batteries, so there are less 
constraints on how they can be safely disposed [147]. However, they do 
not have as high of energy density as lithium batteries [147]. Nickel metal 
hydride batteries were first developed in the 1960s for satellite applications, 
and research into them accelerated in the 1970s and 1980s. At the time, 
they were used in early laptops and cellphones, but lithium batteries are 
used in these applications today [128, p. 22.1]. They are found now in

replacement unit which powers the International Space Station. This figure

some portable tools, in some cameras, and in some electronics requiring 
repeated recharging cycles or requiring high current output. The International 
Space Station is powered by 48 orbital replacement units, and each 
orbital replacement unit contains 38 nickel-hydrogen battery cells. Figure 

9.8 illustrates an orbital replacement unit [148]. 
9.5.5 Lithium 
Lithium has a high specific energy, so it is very reactive and a good choice 
for battery research. For this reason, many different battery chemistries 
utilizing lithium have been developed. The anode may be made out of 
lithium or carbon [128, ch. 8,15]. Possible cathode materials include MnO2, 
LiCoO2, and FeS2 
[128, ch. 8,15]. Electrolytes may be liquid or solid. A 
possible electrolyte is the mixture of an organic solvent such as propylene 
carbonate and dimethoxyethane mixed with lithium salts such as LiBF4 
or 
LiClO4 
[128, p. 31.5]. Figure 9.9 shows lepidolite, a lithium containing ore 
of composition K(Li,Al)23(AlSi3O10)(O,OH,F)2, from Ruggles mine near 
Grafton, New Hampshire. 

Lithium batteries have been in development since the 1960s, and they 

 
9 BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS 229 

were used in the 1970s in military applications [128, p. 14.1]. Both primary 
and secondary lithium batteries are available today. They are popular due 
to their high specific energy and energy density. They are used in many 
consumer goods including cellphones, laptops, portable electronics, hearing 
aids, and other medical devices [149]. Many lithium batteries are designed 
to output relatively low current to prevent damage, and secondary lithium 
batteries require controlled recharging to prevent damage [128, ch. 15]. 
Even with these limitations, over 250 million cells are produced each month 
[128, ch. 15].

9.6 Fuel Cells 
9.6.1 Components of Fuel Cells and Fuel Cell Systems 
A fuel cell is a device which converts chemical energy to electrical energy 
through the oxidation of a fuel. Like batteries, all fuel cells contain an 
anode from which electrons and ions flow away, a cathode from which electrons 
and ions flow towards, and an electrolyte. The electrodes are typically 
porous which makes it easier for the fuel and oxidizer to get to the reaction 
site, provides more surface area for the reaction to occur, allows for a 
higher current through the electrode, and allows for less catalyst to be used 
[60, ch. 5]. The electrolyte may be a liquid or a solid. Examples of liquid 
electrolytes include potassium hydroxide solution and phosphoric acid solution 
[128]. Examples of solid electrolytes include (ZrO )0:85(CaO) and

20:15 
(ZrO2)0:9(Y2O3)0:1 
[60]. Also like a battery, individual cells may be stacked 
together in a package. A single fuel cell may have a cell voltage of a few 
volts, but multiple cells may be packaged together in series to produce tens 
or hundreds of volts from the unit.

Table 9.3: Fuel cell components. 

In addition to these components, fuel cells often contain a thin polymer 
membrane, and fuel cell electrodes are often coated with a catalyst which 
speeds up the chemical reaction. An example material used to make the 
membrane is a 0.076 cm layer of polystyrene [60, ch. 10]. Another example 
membrane is polybenzimidazole containing phosphoric acid [128, ch. 37]. 
Membranes allow ions, but not the fuel and oxidizer to pass through [60, 
ch. 10]. In addition to selectively allowing ions to pass through, membranes 
should be chemically stable to not break down in the presence of the often 
acidic or alkaline electrolyte, should be electrical insulators, and should be 
mechanically stable [60, ch. 10]. A useful catalyst speeds up the reaction at 
the electrodes. In addition, a good catalyst must not dissolve or oxidize in 
the presence of the electrolyte, fuel, and oxidizer [60, ch. 8]. Additionally, 
it should only catalyze the desired reaction, not other reactions [60, ch. 
8]. Examples of catalysts used include platinum, nickel, acetylacetone, and 
sodium tungsten bronze NaxWO3 
with 0:2 
<x< 
0:93, [60, ch. 6]. 

During operation, the fuel and oxidizer are continuously supplied to 
the device. Fuel may be in the form of a gas such as hydrogen or carbon 
monoxide gas, it may be in the form of a liquid such as methanol or ammonia, 
or it may be in the form of a solid such as coal [60, ch. 10]. Oxygen 
gas or air which contains oxygen is typically used as the oxidizer [60, ch. 
10]. 

Additional chemical, mechanical, thermal, and electrical components 
are often included in an entire fuel cell system. Some fuel cell systems 
include a fuel processor which breaks down the fuel to convert it to a usable 
form and which filters out impurities [141]. For example, a fuel processor 
may take in coal and produce smaller hydrocarbons which are used as fuel. 
Also, fuel cells system may contain flow plates which channel the fuel and 
oxidizer to the electrodes and channel away the waste products and heat 
[141]. Some fuel cells include heat recovery systems, built in thermoelectric 
devices which convert some of the heat generated back to electricity. For 

 
9 BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS 231 

systems intended to be connected to the electrical grid, inverters which 
convert the DC power from the fuel cell to AC are included. A fuel cell 
system also typically include a control system that regulates the flow of the 
fuel and oxidizer, monitors the temperature of the device, and manages its 
overall operation [128, ch. 37]. 

9.6.2 Types and Examples 
Fuel cells may be classified in different ways. One way is by operating 
temperature: low 25-100 C, medium 100-500 C, high 500-1000 C, and 
very high over 1000 
C [60, ch. 1]. Chemical reactions typically occur more 
quickly at higher temperatures. However, one challenge of designing high 
temperature fuel cells is that materials must be selected that can withstand 
the high temperatures without melting or corroding [60, ch. 2]. 

As with batteries, another way to classify fuel cells is as primary or 
secondary [60, ch. 1]. In a primary fuel cell, also called nonregenerative, 
the reactants are used once then discarded. In secondary fuel cells, also 
called regenerative, the reactants are used repeatedly. An external source 
of energy is needed to refresh the fuel for reuse, and this source may supply 
energy electrically, thermally, photochemically, or radiochemically [60, p. 
515]. Both primary and secondary fuel cells have been made with a variety 
of organic and inorganic fuels [60, p. 515]. 

Another way to classify fuel cells is as direct or indirect [60, ch. 1,7] 
[128, ch. 37]. In a direct fuel cell, the fuel is used as is. In an indirect fuel 
cell, the fuel is processed first inside the system. For example, an indirect 
fuel cell may take in coal and use an enzyme to break it down into smaller 
hydrocarbons before the reaction of the cell [60, ch. 7]. 

Families of fuel cells are often distinguished by the type of electrolyte 
used. Examples include alkaline which use a potassium hydroxide solution 
as the electrolyte, phosphoric acid, molten carbonate, and solid oxide which 
use solid ceramic electrolytes. Other times, fuel cells are categorized by the 
type of membrane or the type of fuel used. Two of the most common types 
of fuel cells are proton exchange membrane fuel cells and direct methanol 
fuel cells [128, ch. 37]. Proton exchange membrane fuel cells use hydrogen 
gas as the fuel, oxygen from air as the oxidizer, a solid electrolyte, and 
a platinum catalyst [128] [141]. They operate at low temperature and 
are used in buses, aerospace applications, and for backup power. Direct 
methanol fuel cells use methanol as a fuel. They also often operate at low 
or medium temperatures [128] and are used for similar applications. 

 
232 9.6 Fuel Cells 

9.6.3 Practical Considerations of Fuel Cells 
The history of fuel cells goes back almost as long as the history of batteries. 
The concept of the fuel cell dates to around 1802 [3, p. 2,222] [60, p. v]. 
Working fuel cells were demonstrated in the 1830s [3, p. 222] [60, p. v], 
and the first practical device was built in 1959 as pure materials became 
commercially available [5, p. 46] [60, p. v, 26]. While both batteries and 
fuel cells are commercially available, batteries have found a home inside 
almost every every car, computer, and electronic devices while fuel cells 
are more specialized products. There are a number of limitations of fuel 
cell technology that have prevented more widespread use. One limitation 
is their cost. Some fuel cells use platinum as the catalyst, and platinum is 
not cheap. Some cells that do not use platinum catalysts have the problem 
that their efficiency is reduced in the presence of carbon monoxide or carbon 
dioxide, which are commonly found in air. Hydrogen gas or methane are 
used as the fuel in some cells, and the delivery and storage of these fuels 
pose challenges. Additionally, some of the more efficient systems are large 
and require fixed space, air or water cooling, and additional infrastructure, 
so these devices do not lend themselves to portable applications. 

Fuel cells have advantages which lead to useful applications. Many fuel 
cells produce no harmful outputs. If hydrogen gas is used as the fuel and 
oxygen from the air is used as the oxidizer, the only byproduct is pure water. 
It is hard to find an energy conversion device which generates electricity 
and is easier on the environment than this type of fuel cell. The left part 
of Fig. 9.10 shows a photograph of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. 
The right part of Fig.9.10 shows an image of the water formed during its operation. 
The image was obtained by the neutron radiography method, and 
it was taken at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center 
for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland. These figures are used 
with permission from [150]. In some applications, the water production is a 
main advantage. NASA space vehicles have used fuel cells to produce both 
electricity and pure water since the Gemini and Apollo projects dating to 
the 1960s [3, p. 250]. They have been used to produce both electricity 
and water on military submarines since the 1960s too [3, p. 250]. Another 
advantage of fuel cells is that they can be more efficient than other devices 
which generate electricity. High temperature and higher power units can 
have efficiencies up to 65% [128]. Since some of the highest efficiencies are 
achieved in higher temperature and higher power devices, fuel cells have 
found a niche in large and stationary applications generating kilowatts or 
megawatts of electricity.

10 MISCELLANEOUS ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES 

10 Miscellaneous Energy Conversion Devices 

10.1 Introduction 
This text is limited to discussing energy conversion devices that involve 
relatively low powers and that involve electrical energy. Furthermore, this 
text excludes energy conversion devices involving magnets and coils. Even 
within these limitations, a wide variety of energy conversion devices have 
been discussed. This chapter briefly mentions a few additional devices that 
meet these criteria. Many more devices exist, and with continued creativity 
and ingenuity by scientists and engineers, more will be developed in the 
future. 

10.2 Thermionic Devices 
Thermionic devices convert thermal energy to electricity using the thermionic 
effect [3, p. 182]. A thermionic device consists of a vacuum tube with electrodes 
in it. The metal cathode is heated until electrons start evaporating 
off the metal. The electrons collect at the anode which is at a colder temperature. 
In a typical device, the cathode may be at a temperature of 1500 
0C, and the distance between the anode and the cathode may be 10 m [60]. 
A device based on this effect was first patented by Thomas Edison in 1883. 
The Carnot efficiency limits this effect because a temperature differential 
is converted to electricity [5]. Efficiencies up to 12% have been measured. 
However, for a given temperature differential, other methods of converting 
temperature difference to electricity are often more efficient. Cathodes 
have been made from tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, and barium oxide 
[3]. The cathode gets used up in the process and eventually needs to 
be replaced. Anodes have been made from copper, cesium, nickel, barium 
oxide, strontium oxide, and silver [3] [60]. Some gas chromatographs use 
nitrogen phosphorous thermionic detectors [151]. 

10.3 Radiation Detectors 
Radiation detectors convert energy from radioactive sources to electricity. 
Excessive radiation can be harmful to people, and humans cannot sense 
radioactivity. We can only measure it indirectly. For these reasons, radiation 
detectors are used as safety devices. Radiation can be classified 
as alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, or neutrons [37, p. 404]. 
Alpha particles are positively charged radiation composed of ionized nuclei 
of helium. Beta particles are high energy electrons. Gamma rays are 

 
238 10.3 Radiation Detectors 

high energy, short wavelength electromagnetic radiation. When these three 
types of radiation interact with air or another gas, they can excite or ionize 
the atoms of the gas. Flowing ions are a current, so this process converts 
the radiation to electricity. Types of radiation detectors include ionization 
chambers, Geiger counters, scintillation counters, and photographic film 
based detectors [37]. 

Ionization chambers and Geiger counters work on the same principle. 
In both cases, a gas is enclosed in a chamber or tube, and a voltage is 
applied across the gas [37]. Incoming alpha particles, beta particles, or 
gamma rays, ionize the gas. Due to the applied voltage, positive ions 
flow to one of the electrodes, and negative ions flow to the other electrode 
thereby forming a current. Geiger counters operate at higher voltages than 
ionization chambers. The voltage between the electrodes in an ionization 
chamber may be from a few volts to hundreds of volts while the voltage is 
a Geiger counter is typically from 500 V to 2000 V [37]. Many smoke detectors 
are ionization chambers [152]. When no smoke is present, radiation 
from a weak radiation source ionizes air between the electrodes, and a current 
is detected on the electrodes. When smoke is present, it scatters the 
radiation, so no current is detected [152]. In an ionization chamber, each 
incoming radioactive particle causes a single atom to ionize. In a Geiger 
counter, an incoming radioactive particle causes an atom to ionize. Then, 
the ions formed ionize additional atoms of the gas, and these ions ionize 
additional atoms forming a cascading reaction powered and maintained by 
the voltage gradient which accelerates and separates the ion pairs. Geiger 
counters are often more sensitive due to this amplification of the current 
produced. 

Scintillation counters and photographic film based detectors involve an 
additional step in converting radiation to electricity. A scintillation counter 
is often made from a crystalline material such as sodium iodide [37]. Sometimes 
a phosphor is also used [5, p. 166]. Incoming radioactive particles 
excite, but do not ionize, the atoms of the material. These atoms then 
decay and emit a photon. Semiconductor or other types of photodetectors 
convert the photons to electricity [37]. In photographic film based detectors, 
incoming radioactive particles expose the film thereby changing its color 
[37]. Materials used in the film include Al2O3 
and lithium fluoride [153]. 
Again, photodetectors are used to convert the information recorded on the 
film to a measurable signal. Scintillation counters can be higher sensitivity 
than other types of radiation detectors, and they can be used to determine 
the energy of incoming radiation by spectroscopy [154]. The film based 
detectors can be worn as a ring or badge. These type of detectors are used, 
for example, by radiology technicians and by nuclear power plant employ


 
10 MISCELLANEOUS ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES 239 

ees. These detectors must be sent in to a lab to be analyzed, and both the 
amount and the type of radiation can be determined [153]. 

10.4 Biological Energy Conversion 
The human body can be considered an energy conversion device. Humans 
take in chemical energy in the form of food and convert it to kinetic energy, 
heat, and other forms of energy. Some components of the human body are 
also energy conversion devices. Muscles convert chemical energy to kinetic 
energy. Photoreceptors in the retina of the eye convert optical energy of 
photons to electrical energy of neurons. The ear converts sound waves to 
energy stored in the pressure of the fluid of the inner ear, kinetic energy of 
moving hairs that line the cochlea of the inner ear, and electrical energy of 
neurons. The human body also stores energy. Muscles can store energy as 
they stretch and contract. Human fat cells store energy in chemical form. 
When you walk, your center of mass moves up and down storing energy in 
pendulum-like motion [155]. Additionally, bone, skin, and collagen exhibit 
piezoelectricity [156]. 

Neurons are nerve cells that convert chemical energy to electrical energy. 
The human brain has around 1011 
neurons [157, p. 135]. They are 
composed of a cell body, an axon, dendrites, and synapses [158]. The axon 
is the fibrous part that transmits information to other neurons. The dendrites 
are the fibrous part that receives information from other neurons. A 
synapse is a gap between neurons. Ions, such as Na+ 
, 
K+ 
, 
or Cl 
, build 
up on the membrane or in the gap between two neurons, and the charge 
separation of the ions causes an electrical potential [157]. Ions sometimes 
cross the gap between neurons. Neurons may be classified as sensory afferents, 
interneurons, or motoneurons [157]. Sensory afferents transmit a 
signal from sensory receptors to the nervous system. Interneurons transmit 
the signal throughout the nervous system, and motoneurons transmit the 
signal from the nervous system to muscles [157]. Electrical signals transmitted 
along the nervous system involve pulses with a duration of a few 
milliseconds [157]. The information is encoded in the frequency rate of the 
pulses [157]. 

10.5 Resistive Sensors 
Sensors may be made from capacitive, inductive, or resistive materials. 
These sensors may involve direct energy conversion or may involve multiple 
energy conversion processes. In Chapters 2 and 3 capacitive energy 
conversion devices were discussed. The capacitance C 
of a parallel plate

capacitor is given by

. 
(10.1)
dthick 
If the permittivity , 
cross sectional area A, or separation of the plates 
dthick 
change with respect to any effect, we can make a capacitive sensor. 
Capacitive sensors are calibrated devices which involve energy conversion 
between electricity and material polarization. While most inductive energy 
conversion devices are outside the scope of this book, a few such devices 
were discussed in Chapters 4 and 5. The inductance L 
of a single turn 
inductor is given by 

dthick

L 
= 
. 
(10.2) 

w 
If the permeability , thickness dthick, or width w 
change with respect to 
any effect, we can make an inductive sensor which utilizes energy conversion 
between electricity and magnetic energy. Similarly, the resistance R 
of a 
uniform resistive device is given by 

l 


R 
= 
. 
(10.3)

A 


If the resistivity , length l, or cross sectional area A 
change with respect 
to any effect, we can make a resistive sensor. When a current is applied 
through a resistive sensor, energy is converted from electricity to heat, and 
a resistive sensor is calibrated so that a given voltage drop corresponds to 
a known change in some parameter. 

Many resistive senors are available. A potentiometer is a variable resistor. 
As current flows through it, energy is converted from electricity 
to heat. When the knob of a potentiometer is turned, the length of the 
material through which the current flows is changed, so the rate of energy 
conversion through the device changes. A resistance temperature detector 
converts a temperature difference to electricity [37, p. 88]. Resistance temperature 
detectors work based on the idea of the Thomson effect discussed 
in Section 8.6.1. In these devices, the resistivity varies with temperature. 
When a strain is applied to a resistive strain gauge, both the length and 
cross sectional area of the device change. Pirani hot wire gauges are used 
to measure pressure in low pressure environments [37, p. 97]. In a Pirani 
gauge, current is applied through a metallic filament, and the filament 
heats up. As air molecules hit the filament, heat is transferred away from 
it. The resistance of the filament depends on temperature, and the filament 
cools more quickly in an environment with more air molecules than 
in an environment at a lower pressure. By monitoring the resistance of the 
filament, the pressure can be determined.

10.6 Electrofluidics 
Electrohydrodynamic devices (EHDs) convert between electrical energy and 
fluid flow. These devices are also known as electrokinetic devices. Microfluidic 
devices are EHD devices that are patterned on a single silicon wafer or 
other substrate, and length scales are often less than a millimeter [159]. Engineers 
have built EHD pumps, valves, mixers, separators, and other EHD 
devices [159] [160]. Electrohydrodynamic or microfluidic devices have been 
used in products including ink jet printers, chemical detectors, machines 
for DNA sequencing or protein analysis, and insulin pumps [61] [160] [161]. 

Some EHD devices operate based on the idea of Bernoulli's equation, 
and this relationship is a direct consequence of energy conservation. To 
illustrate the fundamental physics of this idea, begin by considering a simpler 
device, a constricted pipe. This pipe converts energy from a pressure 
differential to kinetic energy [103, ch. 3] [162, p. 346]. Consider a fluid with 
zero viscosity and zero thermal conductivity flowing through a horizontal 
pipe (so gravity can be ignored). Figure 10.1 illustrates this geometry. 

!

The velocity  
v 
and pressure P 
are different at locations with different pipe 
diameter, for example locations 1 and 2 in the figure. Consider a small 
amount of water with mass m 
= 
densV 
where dens 
is density and V 
is the small volume. Assume there are two, and only two, components 
of energy: kinetic energy and energy due to the compressed fluid. In going 
from location 1 to location 2, the pressure of this little mass of fluid 
changes. Change in energy due to compressing this drop of water is equal 
to (P1 
 
P2)V. The kinetic energy also changes, and change in kinetic 
energy is given by

Bernoulli's equation is also used to describe the lift of an air foil or the path 
of a curve ball in baseball [162, p. 350]. In some EHDs electricity induces 
changes in the pressure or volume of a microfluidic channel. The fluid in 
these devices may be conductive or insulating. As seen by Eq. 10.8, this 
change in pressure induces a change in fluid velocity. 

In other EHDs, applied voltages exert forces on conductive fluids. A 



 


charged object in an external electric field E 
feels a force in the direction 



 


of the electric field. A current in an external magnetic field B 
feels a force. 
The direction of this force is perpendicular to both the direction of the 
current and the direction of the external magnetic field. These effects are 
summarized by the Lorentz force equation

which was discussed in Chapter 5. In that chapter, Hall effect devices 
and magnetohydrodynamic devices were discussed, both of which can be 
understood by the Lorentz force equation with an external magnetic field 
but no electrical field. This type of EHD can be understood by the Lorentz 
force equation with an external electric field but no magnetic field. The 
liquid in these devices must be conductive. When a voltage is applied 
across this type of EHD, an electric field is induced which causes the liquid 
to flow, and this effect is said to be due to a streaming potential [159]. A 
related effect called electrophoresis occurs in liquids which contain charged 

 
10 MISCELLANEOUS ENERGY CONVERSION DEVICES 243 

particles [161]. If an electric field is applied, these particles will move. This 
effect has been demonstrated with charged DNA molecules and charged 
protein molecules in solutions [161]. 

Other EHD devices operate by changing material polarization of an 
insulating liquid, and this effect is called dielectrophoresis. The concept 
of material polarization was discussed in Section 2.2.1. If we apply an 
electric field across a conductor, whether that conductor is a solid or a 
liquid, charges will flow. If we apply an electric field across a dielectric, 
the material may polarize. In other words, there will be some net charge 
displacement even if all electrons remain bound to atoms. The external 
electric field causes both the atoms of the liquid to polarize and these 
polarized atoms to flow. 

There are a number of other interrelated EHD effects. Electroosmosis 
can occur in fluids with a surface charge. In some liquids, ions build up on 
the surface due to unpaired chemical bonds, due to ions adsorbed onto the 
surface, or for other reasons. If an electric field is applied across this layer 
of charges, the fluid will flow, and this effect is called electroosmosis [161] 
[159]. Also, an external electric field applied across a fluid may heat up 
part of the fluid and cause a temperature gradient. Fluid may flow due to 
the temperature gradient, and this effect is called electrothermal flow [161]. 
Another effect, known as electrowetting, occurs in conductive liquids. At 
the interface of a solid conductor and a conductive liquid, charges build up 
[61]. Again, if an electric field is applied, the liquid will flow.

11 Calculus of Variations 

11.1 Introduction 
The previous chapters surveyed various energy conversion devices. The purpose 
of Chapters 11 and 12 is to establish a general framework to describe 
any energy conversion process. By placing energy conversion processes in 
a larger framework, we may be able to see relationships between processes 
or identify additional energy conversion processes to study. Establishing 
this framework requires some abstraction and hence some mathematics. In 
the next section, we define the Principle of Least Action and the idea of 
calculus of variations. In the following sections, we apply these ideas to two 
example energy conversion systems: a mass spring system and a capacitor 
inductor system. 

An advantage of using calculus of variations over other techniques is that 
the analysis is based on energy, which is a scalar, instead of the potential, 
which may be a scalar or vector. Working with a scalar quantity like energy 
instead of a vector can make the mathematics quite a bit more manageable. 

11.2 Lagrangian and Hamiltonian 
Consider a process which converts energy from one form to another. We 
are interested in how some quantity evolves during the energy conversion 
process, and we call this quantity the generalized path, y(t). For simplicity, 
we consider only the case where this path has one independent variable t 
and one dependent variable y. In this chapter, t 
represents time, but it 
can also represent position or another independent variable. These ideas 
generalize directly to situations with multiple independent and dependent 
variables [163] [164], but the multiple variable problem requires more involved 
mathematics. The units of generalized path depend on the energy 
conversion process under consideration. In the mass spring example of Sec. 
11.5, it represents position of a mass. In the capacitor inductor example of 
Sec. 11.6, it represents the charge built up on the plates of the capacitor. 
Aside from the energy conversion process under consideration, assume that 
no other energy conversion processes occur, even though this situation is 
unlikely. The system goes from having all energy in the first form to having 
all energy in the second form following the path y(t). 


 
246 11.2 Lagrangian and Hamiltonian 

Define the Lagrangian L 
as the difference between the first and second 
forms of energy under consideration. The Lagrangian is a function of t, y, 
and dy 
, and it has the units of joules.

At any time, the total energy of the system is the sum. Define the Hamiltonian 
H, 
also in joules, as the total energy.

Some forms of energy cannot be described by a Lagrangian of the form

and instead require a Lagrangian of the form

[163, p. 56]. Such forms of energy will not be considered here. Energy is 
conserved in any energy conversion process. Conservation of energy can be 
expressed as

Derivatives of the Lagrangian will be useful in the discussion below. 
Define the generalized potential as the partial derivative of the Lagrangian 
with respect to the path, @@y 
L 
. The units of the generalized potential depend 
on the units of the path. More specifically, the units of the generalized 
potential are joules divided by the units of the path. Note that generalized 
potential and potential energy are different ideas. Potential energy 
has units of joules while the units of generalized potential vary. Some authors 
use the term potential as a synonym for voltage, but this definition 
of generalized potential is more broad. For more information on the distinction 
between potential, generalized potential, and potential energy see 
Appendix C. 

Define the generalized momentum M 
as the partial derivative of the 
Lagrangian with respect to the time derivative of the path.

Many authors use the variable p 
for generalized momentum. However, M 
will be used here because the variable p 
is already too overloaded. Defi
ne the generalized capacity as the ratio of the generalized path to the 
generalized potential.

along the path.

Assuming the independent variable t 
represents time in seconds, the action 
will have the units joule seconds. For energy conversion processes, the path 
found in nature experimentally is the path that minimizes the action. This 
idea is known as the Principle of Least Action or sometimes as Hamilton's 
principle [163, p. 11]. The idea of conservation of energy is contained in 
this principle. 

To find a minimum or maximum of a function, find where the derivative 
of the function is zero. Here, L 
and H 
are not quite functions. Instead, 
they are functionals.A function takes a scalar quantity as an input and 
returns a scalar quantity. A functional takes a function as an input and 
returns a scalar quantity. Both L 
and H 
take the function y(t) 
as input 
and return a scalar quantity in joules. The idea of taking a derivative and 
setting it to zero to find a minimum is still useful, but we have to take 
the derivative with respect to the function y(t). 
The process of finding the 
maximum or minimum of a functional described by an integral relationship 
is known as calculus of variations. 

It is often easier to work with differential relationships than integral 
relationships. We can express the Principle of Least Action as differential 
equation, and it is called the Euler-Lagrange equation.

If the Lagrangian L 
is known, we can simplify the Euler-Lagrange equation 
to an equation involving only the unknown path. The resulting equation 
in terms of path y(t) 
is called the equation of motion. 

 
248 11.3 Principle of Least Action 

The Lagrangian provides a ton of information about an energy conversion 
process. If we can describe the difference between two forms of energy 



dy

by a Lagrangian L 
t, 
y, 
dt 
, we can set up the Euler-Lagrange equation. 
From the Euler-Lagrange equation, we may be able to find the equation of 
motion and solve it. The resulting path minimizes the action and describes 
how the energy conversion process evolves with time. We can find the 
generalized potential of the system as a function of time too. The Euler-
Lagrange equation is a conservation law for the generalized potential. The 
symmetries of the equation of motion may lead to further conservation laws 
and invariants. These last two ideas, and the math behind them, are often 
known as Noether's theorem. Noether's theorem says that there is a very 
close relationship between symmetries of either the path or the equation of 
motion and conservation laws [165] [166]. These ideas are discussed further 
in Sec. 14.5. 

Notice the mix of partial and total derivative symbols in Eq. 11.8. 
Since y(t) 
depends on only one independent variable, there is no need 
to use partial derivatives in expressing dy 
. The derivative dy 
is written in

dt 
dt 
y

shorthand notation as y_, and y¨ 
may be used in place of ddt 
2
2 
. 
The Lagrangian 
L 
depends on three independent-like variables: t, 
y, and dy 
. Thus, the

dt 


partial derivative symbols are used to indicate which partial derivative of 
L 
is being considered. 
The first term of the Euler-Lagrange equation, @@y 
L 
, is the generalized potential 
defined above. The units of the generalized potential are joules over 
J

units of path, Each term of the Euler-Lagrange equation 

units of path . 
has these units. For example, if y(t) 
is in the units of meters, the generalized 
J

potential is in or newtons. Each term of the Euler-Lagrange equation 

m 
represents a force, and the Euler-Lagrange equation is a conservation relationship 
about forces. As another example, if the path y(t) 
represents 
charge in coulombs, then the generalized potential has the units JC which 
is volts. The Euler-Lagrange equation in this case is a conservation relationship 
about voltages.

11.4 Derivation of the Euler-Lagrange Equation 
In this section, we use the Principle of Least Action to derive a differential 
relationship for the path, and the result is the Euler-Lagrange equation. 
This derivation closely follows [163, p. 23-33], so see that reference for 
a more rigorous derivation. Assume that we know the Lagrangian which 
describes the difference between two forms of energy, and we know the 
action. We want to find a differential relationship for the path y(t) 
which 
minimizes the action. This path has the smallest integral over t 
of the 
difference between the two forms of energy. 

Suppose that the path y(t) 
minimizes the action and is the path found 
in nature. Consider a path y~(t) 
which is very close to the path y(t). Path 
y~(t) 
is equal to path y(t) 
plus a small difference.

Path y

is positive for all possible choices 
of (t). The only way this can occur is if the first variation is zero.

We have completed the derivation. Using the Principle of Least Action, 
we have derived the Euler-Lagrange equation. If we know the Lagrangian 
for an energy conversion process, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation 
to find the path describing how the system evolves as it goes from having 
energy in the first form to the energy in the second form. 

The Euler-Lagrange equation is a second order differential equation.

Lagrangian. 

11.5 Mass Spring Example 
Examples in this section and the next section will illustrate how we can use 
the Euler-Lagrange equation to find the equation of motion describing an 
energy conversion process. Consider a system comprised of a mass and a 
spring where energy is transfered between spring potential energy stored in 
the compressed spring and kinetic energy of the mass. The mass is specified 
by m 
in kg. It is attached to a spring with spring constant K 
in mJ 
2 
. The 
position of the mass is specified by x(t) 
where x 
is the dependent variable 
in meters and t 
is the independent variable time in seconds. Assume this 
mass and spring are either fixed on a level plane or in some other way 

 
252 11.5 Mass Spring Example 

not influenced by gravity. This mass spring system is illustrated on the 
left side of Fig. 11.1. When the spring is compressed, the system gains 
spring potential energy. When the spring is released, energy is converted

conversion processes, such as heating due to friction, occur.

Figure 11.1: A mass spring system. 

The right side of Fig. 11.1 shows the compressed spring held in place 
by a restraint. For t< 
0, 
the system has no kinetic energy because the 
mass is not moving, and the system has potential energy in the compressed 
spring. At this time, the mass is at position x 
where x< 
0. The spring 
exerts a force on the mass, 



 


F

= 
Kxa^x 
(11.27) 

which is in the a^x 
direction. 

At t

the restraint is removed, and the spring potential energy is 
converted to kinetic energy. The first form is spring potential energy.

At t

we know the Lagrangian, we can find the path by trial and error. To find 
the path in this way, guess a path x(t)

the action.

Repeatedly guess another path, and calculate the action. The path with 
the least action of all possible paths is the path that the mass follows. 
This path has the smallest difference between the potential energy and the 
kinetic energy integrated over time. 

We can think of many possible, but not physical, paths x(t) 
that the 
mass can follow. Figure 11.2 illustrates two nonphysical paths as well as the 
physical path derived below. Paths are considered over the time interval 
0 
<t< 
1. 
All three paths assume that initially, at t 
=0, the spring is 
compressed so that the mass is at location x(0) 
= 
1. 
Also, they assume 
that at the end of the interval, at t 
=1, 
the spring has expanded so that 
the mass is at location x(1) 
= 
1. 
The possible paths illustrated in the figure 
are

x2(t)=2t2

The path x1(t) 
describes a case where the mass travels at a constant speed. 
The path x2(t) 
describes a case where the mass accelerates when the restraint 
is removed, and the path x3(t) 
describes a case where the mass first 
accelerates then slows. The action of each path can be calculated using Eq. 

11.36. For example purposes, the values of m 
=1 
kg and K 
=

are 
used. The path x1(t) 
has S 
=0:355, 
the path x2(t) 
has S 
=0:364, and the 
physical path x3(t) 
has zero action S 
=0. 
We can derive the path that minimizes the action and that is found in 
nature using the Euler-Lagrange equation.

represents the acceleration of the mass. We have just found the equation of 
motion, and it is a statement of Newton's second law, force is mass times 
acceleration. It is also a statement of conservation of force on the mass. 

Equation 11.38 is a second order linear differential equation with constant 
coefficients. It is the famous wave equation, and its solution is well

securely attach the mass to the spring, as opposed to letting the mass get 
kicked away, it will oscillate as described by the path x(t). 

Energy is conserved in this system. To verify conservation of energy, 
we can show that the total energy does not vary with time. The total 
energy is given by the Hamiltonian of Eq. 11.31. In this example, both 
the Hamiltonian and the Lagrangian do not explicitly depend on time, 
@H

and @L 
=0. 
Instead, they only depend on changes in time. For 

@t

this reason, we say both the total energy and the Lagrangian have time 
translation symmetry, or we say they are time invariant. The spring and 
mass behave the same today, a week from today, and a year from today.

This example is summarized in Table 11.1. In analogy to language used 
to describe circuits and electromagnetics, the relationship between the generalized 
path and the generalized potential is referred to as the constitutive 
relationship. Following Eq. 11.6, the ratio of the generalized path to generalized 
potential is the generalized capacity, and in this example, it is the 
inverse of the spring constant. While displacement x 
is assumed to be

scalar, the vector

11.6 Capacitor Inductor Example 
The ideas of calculus of variations apply to energy conversion processes in 
electrical systems too. Consider a circuit with a capacitor and an inductor 
as shown in Figure 11.3. The current iL, the current ic, 
and the voltage 
v 
are defined in the figure. Assume that wires and components have no 
resistance. While this is not completely physical, it will allow us to simplify 
the problem. Assume that the capacitor is charged for t< 
0, and the switch 
is open. At t 
=0, 
the switch is closed, and the capacitor begins discharging. 
In this example, the generalized path will be the charge built up on the 
plates of the capacitor. We can derive the equation of motion that describes 
this path. 

t=0iLicv
Figure 11.3: A capacitor inductor system. 

Energy is converted between two forms. The first form of energy in this 
system is electrical energy stored in the capacitor. The voltage v 
in volts 
across a capacitor is proportional to the charge Q 
in coulombs across the 
plates of the capacitor. Capacitance C, measured in farads, is the constant 
of proportionality between the two measures.

The second form of energy in this system is the energy stored in the 
magnetic field of the inductor. The current iL 
through the inductor, measured 
in amperes, is proportional to the magnetic flux 	, measured in 
webers, around the inductor. Inductance L, measured in henries, is the 
constant of proportionality between the current and magnetic flux.

We describe the energy conversion process by keeping track of a the 
generalized path Q(t), the charge stored on the capacitor. The variable t 
represents the independent variable time in seconds, and Q 
is the dependent 
variable charge in coulombs. The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian, H 
and L, 
will be considered functions of three independent-like variables: t, 
Q, and 

dQ 


.

The Hamiltonian is the sum of the energy in the capacitor and the 
energy in the inductor. The Lagrangian is the difference between these 
energies.

Electrical engineers typically describe physical circuits using the most easily 
measured quantities: current and voltage. However, here to illustrate the

made of only a capacitor and inductor is an oscillator.

262 11.7 Schrödinger's Equation 

11.7 Schrödinger's Equation 
Quantum mechanics is the study of microscopic systems such as electrons 
or atoms. Calculus of variations and the idea of a Hamiltonian are fundamental 
ideas of quantum mechanics [136]. In Chapter 13, we apply the 
ideas of calculus of variations to an individual atom in a semiclassical way. 

We can never say with certainty where an electron or other microscopic 
particle is located or its energy. However, we can discuss the probability of 
finding it with a specific energy. The probability of finding an electron, for 
example, in a particular energy state is specified by j j2 
where ψ 
is called 
the wave function [136]. As with any probability 0 
j j2 
≤ 
1. 


For example, suppose that as an electron moves, kinetic energy is converted 
to potential energy. The quantum mechanical Hamiltonian HQM 
is 
then the sum of the kinetic energy Ekinetic 
and potential energy Epotential 
energy. 

HQM 
= 
Ekinetic 
+ 
Epotential 
energy 
(11.64) 

Kinetic energy is expressed as 

1 


2

Ekinetic 
=(MQM 
) 
(11.65)

2m 


where m 
is the mass of an electron. In the expression above, MQM 
is the 
quantum mechanical momentum operator, and 

(MQM 
)2 
= 
MQM 
· 
MQM 
. 
(11.66) 

The quantum mechanical momentum operator is defined by 



 


MQM 
= 
j~r 
(11.67) 

where the quantity ~is the Planck constant divided by 2". 
The del operator,



 


r, was introduced in Sec. 1.6.1, and it represents the spatial derivative of 



 


a function. The quantities HQM 
, MQM 
, and r 
are all operators, not just 
values. An operator, such as the derivative operator dt
d 
, acts on a function. 
It itself is not a function or value. 

Using the of momentum definition of Eq. 11.67 and the vector identity 
of Eq. 1.10, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian.

Equation 11.71 is the time independent Schrödinger equation, and it is one 
of the most fundamental equations in quantum mechanics. Energy level 
diagrams were introduced in Section 6.3. Allowed energies illustrated by 
energy level diagrams satisfy the Schrödinger equation. At least for simple 
atoms and ground state energies, energy level diagrams can be derived by 
solving Schrödinger equation.

that minimizes the action, we can solve the

qdy

Euler-Lagrange equation, with L 
= 
1+ 
dx 
as the Lagrangian, 
for this shortest path y(x). This approach can be used because we 
want to minimize the integral of some functional L 
even though this 
functional does not represent an energy difference [163, p. 33]. 

Set up the Euler-Lagrange equation, and solve it for the shortest 
path, y(x). 

Hint 1: The answer to this problem is that the shortest path between 
two points is a straight line. Here, you will derive this result. 
Hint 2: In the examples of this chapter, the Lagrangian had the form 

 

L

with independent variable t

11.7. Light travels along the quickest path between two points. This idea 
is known as Fermat's principle. In a material with relative permittivity 
r 
and permeability 0, light travels at the constant speed pcr 
where c 
is the speed of light in free space. In Prob. 11.6, we showed 
that the shortest path between two points is a straight line, so in a 
uniform material, light will travel along a straight line between two 
points. However, what if light travels across a junction between two 
materials? In this problem, we will answer this question and derive 
 
266 11.8 Problems 

a famous result known as Snell's law. 

Consider the figure below. Assume that a ray of light travels from 
(x0;y0) 
to (x1;y1) 
along the path which takes the shortest time. Material 
1 has relative permittivity r1, so the light travels in that material 
at a constant speed √ 

c 
r1 
. 
Material 2 has relative permittivity r2, so 
the light travels in that material at a constant speed √ 

c 
r2 
. 
As we 
derived in the Prob. 11.6, the light travels along a straight line in 
material 1, and it travels along a straight line in material 2. However, 
the lines have different slopes as shown in the figure. Assume that 
the junction of the two materials occurs at x 
=0. 

(a) Find an equation for the total time it takes the light to travel as 
a function of h, the vertical distance at which the path crosses 
the y 
axis. Note that you are finding a function here, F 
(h), 
not a functional. You can use the fact that you know the light 
follows a straight line inside each material to find this function. 
(b) The path followed by the light takes the minimum time, so the 
dF

derivative dh 
=0. Use this idea to find an equation for the 
unknown vertical height h. Your answer can be written as a 
function of the known constants r1;r2;x0;y0;x1;y1;and c. 
You do not need to solve for h 
here, but instead just evaluate 
the derivative and set it to zero.

12 Relating Energy Conversion Processes 

12.1 Introduction 
In the previous chapter, the concept of calculus of variations was introduced. 
The purpose of this chapter is to draw relationships between a 
wide range of energy conversion processes. Processes in electrical engineering, 
mechanics, thermodynamics, and chemistry are described using the 
language of calculus of variations. Similarities between the processes are 
highlighted and summarized into tables. 

This chapter illustrates how to apply calculus of variations ideas to disparate 
branches of science and engineering. Electrical engineers typically 
use current and voltage to describe circuits. Chemists use temperature, 
pressure, entropy, and volume when describing chemical reactions. Engineers 
and scientists in each discipline have their own favorite quantities. 
However, energy conversion is a common topic of study. Calculus of variations 
provides a unifying language. Scientists and engineers typically specialize, 
becoming experts in a particular area. However, open questions are 
more often found at the boundary between disciplines, where there is less 
expertise. Comparing ideas between different disciplines is useful because 
ideas from one discipline may answer questions in another, and challenges 
in one discipline may pose interesting research questions in another. 

By studying the mass spring system of Sec. 11.5, the resulting equation 
of motion was Newton's second law. By studying the capacitor inductor 
system of Sec. 11.6, the resulting equation of motion was Kirchoff's voltage 
law. In this chapter we identify the equation of motion for multiple 
other systems. Through this procedure, we encounter some of the most 
fundamental laws of physics including including Gauss's laws, conservation 
of momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and the second law of 
thermodynamics. 

The discussion in this chapter is necessarily limited. Entire texts have 
been written about each energy conversion processes discussed. Additionally, 
the idea of applying calculus of variations to these energy conversion 
processes is not novel. Other authors have compared electrical, mechanical, 
and other types of energy conversion processes too [168] [169]. 

Some rather drastic assumptions are made in this chapter. We assume 
energy is converted between one form and another with no other energy 
conversion process occurring. For example in a mass spring system, energy 
is converted between kinetic energy and spring potential energy while ignoring 
heating due to friction, energy conversion due to gravitational potential 
energy, and so on that might occur in a real system. 

 
270 12.2 Electrical Energy Conversion 

12.2 Electrical Energy Conversion 
Electrical can be described either in circuits language or electromagnetics 
language. Using circuits language, electrical systems are described by four 
fundamental parameters: charge in coulombs Q, voltage in volts v, magnetic 
flux in webers 	, and current in amperes i 
. For circuits described in 
this language, resistors, capacitors, and other electrical energy storage and 
conversion devices are treated as point-like with no length or extent, and 
forces and fields outside the path of the circuit are ignored. An alternative 
approach is to use electromagnetics language the electrical properties of 
materials are studied as a function of position and forces and fields outside 
of the path of a circuit are studied. 

We can use circuits language to describe a number of energy conversion 
devices. Resistors convert electrical energy to thermal energy, and thermoelectric 
devices convert thermal energy to or from electrical energy. A 
charging capacitor converts electrical energy to energy stored in a material 
polarization, and a discharging capacitor converts the energy of the material 
polarization back to electrical energy. In an inductor, electrical energy 
is converted to and from energy of a magnetic field. 

In Sec. 11.6, energy storage in a capacitor was studied in detail and 
described in the language of calculus of variations. Table 11.2 summarized 
the use of calculus of variations language to describe the energy conversion 
process, and it is repeated in the second column of the Table 12.1. In that 
example, charge built up on the capacitor plates, Q, was the generalized 
path. The generalized potential was v, the voltage across the capacitor. 
From these choices, other parameters were selected. 

Instead of choosing charge Q 
as the generalized path, we could have 
chosen the generalized path to be one of the other fundamental variables of 
circuit analysis, voltage v, magnetic flux 	, or current i. Table 12.1 summarizes 
parameters that result when we describe energy conversion processes 
occurring in a capacitor or inductor in the language of calculus of variations 
with these choices of generalized path. More specifically, the third 
column shows parameters when voltage is chosen as the generalized path. 
The fourth column shows parameters when magnetic flux is chosen as the 
generalized path, and the fifth column shows parameters when current is 
chosen as the generalized path. By reading down a column of the table, we 
see how to describe a process with this choice of generalized path. By reading 
across the rows of the table, we can draw analogies between parameters 
of energy conversion processes. 

To describe the energy conversion processes occurring in a capacitor, we 
can choose either the charge or voltage to be the generalized path then use 

 
12 RELATING ENERGY CONVERSION PROCESSES 271 

the language of calculus of variations. Notice that if charge is chosen as the 
generalized path as seen in column two of Table 12.1, voltage becomes the 
generalized potential. However, when voltage is chosen as the generalized 
path as seen in column three, charge becomes the generalized potential. 
The path found in nature minimizes the action, and we saw in Sec. 11.6 
that we could use the Euler-Lagrange equation to set up an equation of 
motion for the system. Each term of the equation of motion has the same 
units as the generalized potential. The equation of motion found when 
using Q 
as generalized path is Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL), which says 
the sum of all voltage drops around a closed loop in a circuit is zero. The 
equation of motion found when using v 
as the generalized path is the law 
of conservation of charge. Both of these concepts are fundamental ideas in 
circuit theory, and they are shown in the second to last row of the table. 

Similarly, to describe the energy conversion processes occurring in an 
inductor, we may choose either magnetic flux or current as the generalized 
path. If we choose magnetic flux as the generalized path, the generalized 
potential is current. If we choose current as the generalized path, the 
generalized potential is magnetic flux. From the first choice, the equation 
of motion found is Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL). From the second choice, 
the equation of motion found is conservation of magnetic flux. 

The relationship between the generalized path and the generalized potential 
is known as the constitutive relationship [168, p. 30]. For a capacitor, 
it is given as 

Q 
= 
Cv. 
(12.1) 

The constant C 
that shows up in this equation is the capacitance in farads. 
Analogously for an inductor, the constitutive relationship is 

	= 
Li 
(12.2) 

where L 
is the inductance in henries. We will see that we can identify 
constitutive relationships for other energy conversion processes, and we 
similarly can come up with a parameter describing the ability to store 
energy in the device. In analogy to the capacitor, we will call this parameter 
the generalized capacity. Capacitance C 
represents the ability to store 
energy in the device, so generalized capacity represents the ability to store 
energy in other devices. Overloading of the term capacity is discussed in 
Appendix C.

electromagnetic fields are generalizations of the circuit parameters charge 
Q, voltage v, magnetic flux 	, and current i 
respectively as shown in Table 

12.2. However, the electromagnetic fields are functions of position x, 
y, 
and 
z 
in addition to time, and they are vector instead of scalar quantities. More 
specifically, displacement flux density is the charge built up on a surface per 
unit area, and magnetic flux density is the magnetic flux through a surface. 
Similarly, electric field intensity is the negative gradient of the voltage, and 
magnetic field intensity is the gradient of the current. We encountered 
these electromagnetic fields when discussing antennas in Chapter 4. 
A capacitor can store energy in the charge built up between the capacitor 
plates. Analogously, an insulating material with permittivity greater 
than the permittivity of free space, >0, can store energy in the distributed 
charge separation throughout the material. We can describe the 
energy conversion processes occurring in a capacitor using the language 
of calculus of variations by choosing either charge Q 
or voltage v 
as the 
generalized path. Parameters resulting from these choices are shown in the 
second and third column of Table 12.1. Analogously, we can describe the

results in either case is Gauss's law for the electric field,

(12.3) 

where ch 
is charge density. The derivation is beyond the scope of this text, 
however, because it involves applying calculus of variations to quantities 
with multiple independent and dependent variables. Gauss's law is one of 

 
274 12.2 Electrical Energy Conversion 

Maxwell's equations, and it was introduced in Section 1.6.1. In Chapter 2, 
piezoelectric energy conversion devices were discussed, and in Chapter 3, 
pyroelectric and electro-optic energy conversion devices were discussed. All 
of these devices involved converting electrical energy to and from energy 
stored in a material polarization of an insulating material with >0. 
Calculus of variations can be used to describe energy conversion in all of 
these devices with either displacement flux density or electric field intensity 
as the generalized path. For a device made from a material of permittivity



 


 
with an external electric field intensity across it given by E, 
the energy

 


density stored is 12

. The energy stored in a volume V 
is found 
by integrating this energy density with respect to volume, and this energy 
stored in a volume is listed in the second to last row of Table 12.3. Notice 
the similarity of the equation for the energy stored in a capacitor (second 
column, second to last box of Table 12.1) and this equation for the energy 
density stored in a material with >0 
(second column second to last box 
of the Table 12.3). 

Energy can also be stored in materials with permeability greater than 
the permeability of free space, >0. Hall effect devices and magneto-
hydrodynamic devices were discussed in Chapter 5. These devices are all 
inductor-like, and the parameters used to describe inductive energy conversion 
processes in the language of calculus of variations are summarized 
in the last two columns of the Table 12.3. Calculus of variations can be 
used to describe energy conversion processes in these devices with either 
magnetic flux density or magnetic field intensity as the generalized path 
and the other choice as the generalized potential. The equation of motion 
resulting from using calculus of variations to describe inductive systems 
corresponds to Gauss's law for the magnetic field,

276 12.3 Mechanical Energy Conversion 

12.3 Mechanical Energy Conversion 
The previous section summarized how the language of calculus of variations 
can be applied to electrical and electromagnetic energy conversion devices. 
Similarly, this language can be used to describe energy conversion processes 
occurring in linear springs, torsion springs, moving masses, and flywheels. 

We can convert energy to and from spring potential energy by compressing 
and releasing a spring. Similarly, we can store or release energy 
from a moving mass by changing its velocity. A flywheel is a device that 
stores energy in a spinning mass. Flywheels are used, in addition to batteries, 
in some electric and hybrid vehicles because storing rotational kinetic 
energy in a flywheel requires fewer energy conversion processes than storing 
energy in a battery. All of these energy conversion devices can be described 
in the language of calculus of variations with some parameter chosen as the 
generalized path. 

Tables 12.4 and 12.5 summarize the parameters resulting from describing 
mechanical energy conversion processes in the language of calculus of 
variations. While electromagnetic systems are described by four vector 
fields, mechanical systems are described by eight possible vector fields, and 
they are listed along with their units in Table 12.6. Each column of Tables 

12.4 and 12.5 describes the case of choosing a different vector field from 
Table 12.6 as the generalized path. By comparing across the rows of these 
tables as well as the electrical tables, comparisons can be made between 
the different energy conversion processes. 
In Sec. 11.5, energy conversion in a linear spring was discussed in the 
language of calculus of variations. That example considered the displacement 
of a point mass m 
in kg where the generalized path was chosen to 
be displacement x 
in m. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation was New-
ton's second law. Section 11.5 concluded with Table 11.1 summarizing the 
resulting parameters. The third column of the Table 12.4 repeats that 
information. 

Circuit devices are often assumed to be point-like while electromagnetic 
properties of materials, like permittivity and permeability, are specified as 
functions of position. Similarly, mechanical devices can be treated as point-
like or as functions of position. For example, mass is used to describe a 
point-like device while density is used to describe a device that varies with 
position. Researchers studying aerodynamics and fluid dynamics typically 
prefer the latter description. However, in Tables 12.4 and 12.5, point-like 
devices of mass m 
are assumed. Ideas in these tables can be generalized 
to situations where energy conversion devices are not treated as point-like 
and instead mass and other material properties vary with position.

The last rows of Tables 12.4 and 12.5 list the relationship that results 
when an energy conversion device is described in the language of calculus 
of variations, the Euler-Lagrange equation is set up, and the Euler-
Lagrange equation is solved for the equation of motion. The laws that 
result, Newton's second law, conservation of momentum, conservation of 
angular momentum, and conservation of torque, are fundamental ideas of 
mechanics. 

 
282 12.4 Thermodynamic Energy Conversion 

12.4 Thermodynamic Energy Conversion 
Four fundamental thermodynamic properties were introduced in Section 

8.2: volume V, pressure P, temperature T 
, and entropy S. Many devices 
convert between some form of energy and either energy stored in a confined 
volume, energy stored in a material under pressure, energy in a temperature 
difference, or energy of a disordered system. We can describe energy 
conversion processes in these devices using the language of calculus of variations 
with one of these parameters, V, P, T 
, or S, as the generalized 
path and another as the generalized potential. Table 12.7 summarizes the 
results. 
Many sensors convert energy between electrical energy and energy stored 
in a volume, pressure, or temperature difference. A capacitive gauge can 
measure the volume of liquid fuel versus vapor in the tank of an aircraft. 
Strain gauges and Piranhi hot wire gauges (Sec. 10.5), for example, are 
sensors that can measure pressure on solids or in gases. Pyroelectric detectors 
(Sec. 3.2), thermoelectric detectors (Sec. 8.8), thermionic devices 
(Sec. 10.2), and resistance temperature devices (Sec. 10.5) can be used to 
sense temperature changes. 

Many other energy conversion devices convert between energy stored in 
a confined volume, energy stored in a material under pressure, or energy 
in a temperature difference and another form of energy without involving 
electricity. For example, if you tie a balloon to a toy car then release the 
air in the balloon, the toy car will move forward. Energy stored in the 
confined volume of the balloon, as well as in the stretched rubber of the 
balloon, is converted to kinetic energy of the toy car. An aerator or squirt 
bottle converts energy of a pressure difference to kinetic energy of a liquid. 
An eye dropper converts energy of a pressure difference to gravitational 
potential energy. An airfoil converts a pressure difference to kinetic energy 
in the form of lift. A piston converts energy of a gas under pressure to 
kinetic energy. As discussed in Sec. 10.6, a constricted pipe, or a weir, 
converts energy of a pressure difference in a flowing liquid to kinetic energy 
of the liquid. A baseball thrown as a curve ball converts the rotational 
energy of the rotating ball into a pressure differential to deflect the ball's 
path [162, p. 350]. A Sterling engine converts a temperature difference to 
kinetic energy. 

Calculus of variations can be used to gain insights into thermodynamic 
energy conversion processes in these devices. The first step in applying 
the ideas of calculus of variations is to identify an initial and final form 
of energy. The Lagrangian is the difference between these forms of energy 
as a function of time. Some authors choose the Lagrangian as an entropy

instead of an energy [170] [171], but throughout this text Lagrangian is 
assumed to represent an energy as described in Ch. 11. 

Assume that only one energy conversion process occurs in a device. Also 
assume that if we know three (not two) of the four thermodynamic parameters, 
we can calculate the fourth. Additionally, assume small amounts 
of energy are involved, and the energy conversion process occurs in the 
presence of a large external thermodynamic reservoir of energy. 

As with the discussion of the previous tables, each column of Table 

12.7 details the parameters of calculus of variations for a different choice 
of generalized path. In order, the columns can be used to describe energy 
storage in a gas confined to a finite volume, a material under pressure, a 
temperature differential, or an ordered system. The rows are labeled in 
the same way as in the previous tables of this chapter so that analogies 
between the systems can be drawn. 
Energy can be stored and released from a gas confined to a finite volume 
and a gas under pressure. These related energy conversion processes are 
detailed in the second and third columns of Table 12.7 respectively. The 
second column specifies parameters of calculus of variations with volume 
chosen as the generalized path and pressure as the generalized potential. 
The third column specifies parameters with pressure chosen as the generalized 
path and volume as the generalized potential. In reality, energy 
conversion processes involving changes in the pressure and volume of a gas 
are unlikely to occur without a change in temperature or entropy of the 
system simultaneously occurring. Resistive heating, friction, gravity, and 
all other energy conversion processes that could simultaneously occur are 
ignored. Temperature and entropy are explicitly assumed to remain fixed, 
and these assumptions are listed in the last row of the table for emphasis. 
These columns can apply to energy conversion in liquids and solids in 
addition to gases. Using the choice of variables in the second column, the 
capacity to store energy is given by V
B 
where B 
is the bulk modulus in units 
pascals, and it is a measure of the ability of a compressed material to store 
energy [103]. Bulk modulus was introduced in Section 8.2. Using volume as 
the generalized path, the Euler-Lagrange equation can be set up and solved 
for the equation of motion. All terms of the resulting equation of motion 
have the units of pressure, and the equation of motion is a statement of 
Bernoulli's equation, an idea discussed in Section 10.6. 

The fourth and fifth columns of Table 12.7 specify parameters of calculus 
of variations with temperature and entropy chosen as the generalized 
path respectively. A cup of hot liquid stores energy. Similarly, a container 
with two pure gases separated by a barrier stores energy. The system is 
in a more ordered state before the barrier is removed than after, and it 

 
12 RELATING ENERGY CONVERSION PROCESSES 285 

would take energy to restore the system to the ordered state. Both of these 
systems can be described by the language of calculus of variations. As detailed 
in the fourth column, temperature can be chosen as the generalized 
path and entropy can be chosen as the generalized potential. Alternatively 
as detailed in the fifth column, entropy can be chosen as the generalized 
path and temperature can be chosen as the generalized potential. Both 
of these columns assume that the pressure and volume remain constant. 
The quantity Cv, which shows up in these columns, is the specific heat at 

J

constant volume in units gK, and it was introduced in Sec. 8.3. 

The equation of motion that results when temperature is chosen as the 
path and entropy is chosen as the generalized potential is a statement of 
conservation of entropy, and each term of this equation has the units of 
entropy. This relationship is more commonly known as the second law of 
thermodynamics, and it shows up in the second to last row of Table 12.7. 
More commonly, the law is written for a closed system as [109, p. 236], 

ˆ 


Q

S 
=+ 
Sproduced. 
(12.22)

T 


In words, it says the change in entropy within a control mass is equal to 
the sum of the entropy out of the control mass due to heat transfer plus 
the entropy produced by the system. 

(change in entropy)=(entropy out due to heat)+(entropy produced) 


A system can become more organized or more disordered, so S 
may 
be positive or negative. If energy is supplied in or out, entropy can be 

´ 
Q

transfered in or out of a system, so the quantity T 
may be positive or 
negative. 

Energy is listed in the third to last row of Table 12.7 in two different 
forms. The first expression is an integral expression. For example, you 
can integrate the volume with respect to pressure to find the energy of a 
system. 



E 
= 
VdP 
(12.23) 

Alternatively, the second expression 

E 
= 
VP 
(12.24) 

can be used to find change in energy in the case when volume is not a 
strong function of pressure over a small element. 

 
286 12.5 Chemical Energy Conversion 

12.5 Chemical Energy Conversion 
Batteries and fuel cells store energy in the chemical bonds of atoms. These 
devices were studied in Chapter 9. Table 12.8 details how to describe 
the physics of these chemical energy storage devices using the language of 
calculus of variations. 

Sometimes chemists discuss macroscopic systems and describe charge 
distribution in a material by charge density ch 
in units mC 
3 
. In other cases, 
chemists study microscopic systems, where they are more interested in the 
number of electrons N 
and the distribution of these electrons around an 
atom. The second and third columns of Table 12.8 specify how to describe 
the macroscopic systems in the language of calculus of variations while the 
last two columns specify how to describe the microscopic systems. 

In the second column of Table 12.8, the generalized path is ch 
and the 
generalized potential is the redox potential Vrp 
in volts. There is a close 
relationship between the choice of variables specified in the second column 
of Table 12.8 and the choices specified in the second columns of Table 12.1 
and 12.3. More specifically, the generalized path described in the second 
column of Table 12.1 is charge Q 
in coulombs, where charge is the integral 
of the charge density with respect to volume. 



Q 
= 
chdV 
(12.25) 

The generalized path described in the second column of Table 12.3 is dis




 


placement flux density D 
in units mC 
2 
. In the third column of Table 12.8, 
the opposite choice is made with Vrp 
for the generalized path and ch 
for 
the generalized potential. In Chapter 13, we consider a calculus of variations 
problem with this choice of variables in more detail to solve for the 
electron density around an atom. 

Another way to apply the language of calculus of variations to chemical 
energy storage systems is to choose the number of electrons N 
as the 
generalized path and the chemical potential chem 
as the generalized potential 
[172]. This situation is described in the fourth column of the Table 

12.8. We could instead choose chem 
as the generalized path and N 
as the 
generalized potential, and this situation is detailed in the last column of 
Table 12.8. Reference [172] details using calculus of variations with this 
choice of variables. Chemical potential is also known as the Fermi energy 
at T 
=0 
K, and it was discussed in Sections 6.3 and 9.2.3. It represents 
the average between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied energy 
levels. The quantity Eg, which shows up in the fourth row of the table, is 
the energy gap in joules.

13 Thomas Fermi Analysis 

13.1 Introduction 
Where are the electrons found around an atom? This question is difficult for 
a few reasons. First, at temperatures above absolute zero, electrons are in 
continual motion. Second, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that 
we can never know the position and momentum of electrons simultaneously 
with complete accuracy. However, this question isn't hopeless. We can 
find the charge density ch 
which tells us, statistically on average, where 
the electrons are most likely to be found. Understanding the distribution 
of electrons in a material is vital to understanding the chemical properties, 
such as the strength of chemical bonds, as well as the electrical properties, 
such as how much energy is required to remove electrons. 

To answer this question, we will use calculus of variations. The generalized 
path will be voltage V 
, and the generalized potential will be charge 
density ch. A Lagrangian describes an energy difference, and the Lagrangian 
will have the form 

 

dV

In this problem, the independent variable is position, not time. We will 
set up the Euler-Lagrange equation then solve it to find the equation of 
motion. 

Most of this chapter consists of a derivation of the resulting equation 
of motion called the Thomas Fermi equation. With a bit of algebra, we 
can find both the voltage and the charge density around the atom from the 
solution to the Thomas Fermi equation. The procedure is as follows.

Voltage and charge density are algebraically related to the quantity

To attempt to find charge density and voltage as a function of position 
r 
from the center of the atom, we will have to make some rather drastic 
assumptions. This analysis follows works of Thomas [173] and Fermi [174] 
which were originally completed around 1927. This derivation is discussed 
by numerous other authors as well [6] [46] [136] [175]. Because of the severe 
assumptions made below, the results will not be very accurate. However, 
more accurate numerical calculations are based on improved versions of the 
techniques established by Thomas and Fermi. We are discussing the most 
simplified version of the derivation, but this is the basis of more accurate 
approaches.

13.2.2 Notation 
Writing this text without overloading variables has been a challenge. For 
example, V 
is the logical choice for denoting voltage, volume, and velocity. 
Up until now, the context offered clues to the meaning of symbols. However 
in this chapter, we will encounter equations involving both energy and 
electric field, equations involving both voltage and volume, and equations 
involving both mass and momentum. To help avoid confusion from the 
notation, Table 13.1 shows an excerpt of the variable list from Appendix 

A. This table does not list all quantities we will encounter. However, it 
highlights some of the more confusing ones. 
In this chapter, we will encounter many quantities which vary with position. 
We will not encounter any quantities which vary with time. Therefore, 
voltage is denoted by a capital letter, not a lowercase letter. Voltage 
is a function of r, which denotes position in spherical coordinates. Assume 
that the origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the atom 
under consideration. Voltage is always specified with respect to some reference 
level called ground, so assume this zero volt reference level occurs 
at r 
= 
1. Also assume there is no θ 
or φ 
dependence of the voltage. 

!

Therefore, V 
( 
r 
)= 
V 
(r) 
represents voltage.

296 13.3 Derivation of the Lagrangian 

13.2.3 Reciprocal Space Concepts 
The idea of reciprocal space was introduced in Section 6.4 in the context 
of crystalline materials. We can describe the location of atoms in a crystal,

!

for example, as a function of position where position  
r 
is measured in 
meters. In this chapter, we are interested in individual atoms instead of 

!

crystals composed of many atoms. We can plot quantities like energy E( 
r 
)

!

or voltage V 
( 
r 
) as a function of position. Figure 6.11, for example, plots 
energy versus position inside a diode. In Section 6.4, the idea of wave 



 


vector k 
in units of m1 
was introduced. Wave vector represents the 
spatial frequency. We saw that we could plot energy or other quantities 
as a function of wave vector, and Fig. 6.8 is an example of such a plot. 
We will need the idea of wave vector in this chapter because we describe a 
situation where we do not know how the energy varies with position, but 
we do know something about how the energy varies with wave vector. 

13.3 Derivation of the Lagrangian 
The purpose of this chapter is to find the voltage V 
(r) 
and the charge 
density ch(r) 
around an atom, and we will use calculus of variations to 
accomplish this task. We need to make some rather severe assumptions to 
make this problem manageable. Consider an isolated neutral atom with 
many electrons around it. Assume T 
≈ 
0 
K, so all electrons occupy the 
lowest possible energy levels. Assume the atom is spherically symmetric. 
All of the quantities we encounter, such as voltage, charge density, and 
Lagrangian, vary with r 
but do not vary with θ 
or ffi. 
We will use spherical 
coordinates with the origin at the nucleus of the atom. While quantities 
vary with position, assume no quantities vary with time. The charge density 
ch(r) 
tells us where the electrons are most likely on average to be found. 
It is related to the quantum mechanical wave function, , by 

ch 
= 
q 
j j2 
(13.17) 

where q 
is the magnitude of the charge of an electron. Assume that all of 
the electrons surrounding the atom are distributed uniformly and can be 
treated as if they were a uniform electron cloud of some charge density. 

Pick one of the electrons of the atom, and consider what happens when 
the electron is moved radially in and out. Figure 13.1 illustrates this situation. 
As the electron moves, energy conversion occurs. The goal of this 
section is to write down the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian for this energy 
conversion process. We write these quantities in the units of energy per 
unit volume per valence electron under consideration. 

 
13 THOMAS FERMI ANALYSIS 297 

ElectroncloudNucleus-
Electron underconsideration
Figure 13.1: Illustration of an atom. 

To understand what happens when the electron is moved, consider the 
energy of the atom in more detail. Coulomb's law, introduced in Eq. 
1.4, tells us that charged objects exert forces on other charged objects. 



 


More specifically, the electric field intensity E 
due to a point charge of Q 
coulombs a distance r 
away surrounded by a material with permittivity 
is given by 

!

 
Qa^r

E 
=

(13.18)

4r2 


The atom is composed of N 
positively charged protons. The electron under 
consideration feels an attractive Coulomb force due to these protons. Additionally, 
the atom has N 
electrons, and N 
 
1 
of these exert a repulsive 
Coulomb force on the electron under consideration. Since a charge separation 
and electric field exist, energy is stored. Call the component of the 
energy of the atom due to the Coulomb interaction between the protons 
of the nucleus and the electron under consideration ECoulomb 
e 
nucl. Call 
the Coulomb interaction between the electron under consideration and all 
other electrons Ee 
e 
interact. The atom also has kinetic energy. Call the 
kinetic energy of the nucleus Ekinetic 
nucl 
and the kinetic energy of all of the 
electrons Ekinetic 
e. The energy of the atom is the sum of all of these terms.

Energy due to spin of the electrons and protons is ignored as is energy due 
to interaction with any other nearby charged objects. At T 
≈ 
0 
K, the 
kinetic energy of the nucleus will be close to zero, so we can ignore the 
term, Ekinetic 
nucl 
≈ 
0. The quantity Ekinetic 
e 
cannot be exactly zero. In 
Chapter 6 we plotted energy level diagrams for electrons around an atom. 
Even at T 
=0 
K, electrons have some internal energy, and this energy is 
denoted by the energy level occupied. 

 
298 13.3 Derivation of the Lagrangian 

If we have a large atom with many electrons around it, the Coulomb 
interaction between any one electron and the nucleus is shielded by the 
Coulomb interaction from all other electrons. More specifically, suppose 
we have an isolated atom with N 
protons in the nucleus and N 
electrons 
around it. If we pick one of the electrons, ECoulomb 
e 
nucl 
for that electron 
describes the energy stored in the electric field due to the charge separation 
between the nucleus of positive charge Nq 
and that electron. However, 
there are also N 
 
1 
other electrons which have a negative charge. The 
term Ee 
e 
interact 
describes the energy stored in the electric field due to 
the charge separation between the N 
 
1 
other electrons and the electron 
under consideration. These terms somewhat cancel each other out because 
the electron under consideration interacts with N 
protons each of positive 
charge q 
and N 
 
1 
electrons each of negative charge q. 
However, the 
terms do not go away completely. Calculating 

ECoulomb 
e 
nucl 
+ 
Ee 
e 
interact 
(13.20) 

is complicated because the electrons are in motion, and we do not really 
know where they are or even where they are most likely to be found. In 
fact, we are trying to solve for where they are likely to be found. 

As we move the electron under consideration in and out radially, energy 
is transferred between (ECoulomb 
e 
nucl 
+ 
Ee 
e 
interact) 
and Ekinetic 
e. The 
Hamiltonian is the sum of these two forms of energy per unit volume, 
and the Lagrangian is the difference of these two forms of energy per unit 
volume. Both quantities have the units mJ 
3 
. Choose voltage V 
(r) 
as the 
generalized path and charge density ch(r) 
as the generalized potential. 
The independent variable of these quantities is radial position r, not time. 
We can now write the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian.

The next task is to describe the remaining term Ekinetic 
as a function

V 


of the generalized path too. This task is a bit more challenging. We 
continue to take the approach of making severe approximations until it is 
manageable. We need to express ch(r) 
as a function of V 
(r). Then with 

e

some algebra, Ekinetic 
can be written purely as a function of V 
(r):

in some unknown way. Furthermore, the calculation of Ekinetiic 
depends 

V 


on charge density ch(r), which is the unknown quantity we are trying to 
find. We have more luck by describing these quantities in reciprocal space, 
introduced in Sec. 6.4. Position is denoted in reciprocal space by a wave

(13.30) 
We can describe the properties of a material by describing how they 
vary with position in real space. For example, ch(r) 
represents the charge 
density of electrons as a function of distance r 
from the center of the atom. 
We may be interested in how other quantities, such as the energy required 
to rip off an electron or the kinetic energy internal to an electron, vary with 
position in real space too. Instead of describing how quantities vary with 
position in real space, we can describe how quantities vary with spatial 
frequency of electrons. This is the idea behind representing quantities 
in reciprocal space. We may be interested in how the charge density of 

 
300 13.3 Derivation of the Lagrangian 

electrons varies as a function of the spatial frequency of charges in a crystal 
or other material, and this is the idea represented by functions of wave 

"
 


 


vector such as ch 
k 
. We are trying to solve for charge density ch(r). 
We expect that electrons are more likely to be found at certain distances 
r 
from the center of the atom than at other distances. However, there is

"
 


 


no pattern to the charge density as a function of wave vector, ch 
k 
. 



 


Assume that ch 
is roughly constant with respect to | 
k 
| up to some level. 
With some more work, this assumption will allow us to solve for charge 
density ch(r).

higher ones are empty. Similarly, wave vectors are occupied up to some

Charge density is a function of position in real space r, and we are in 
the process of solving for this function, ch(r). 
However, it also depends on 
the Fermi energy Ef

, for the atom. Next, 
we find the relationship between ch

We know something about the wave vectors of filled states in reciprocal 
space. At T

K, the lowest states are filled, and all others are empty, 
and they are filled up to a radius of kf 
. The volume of a sphere of radius 
kf 
is given by 43

, and this represents the number of filled k 
states per 
volume of reciprocal space. We can therefore simplify the expression above.

Notice that the Fermi energy is just a scaled version of the voltage V 
with 
respect to a ground level at r 
= 
1. 
Electrical engineers often use the word 
voltage synonymously with potential. When chemists use the term chemical 
potential, they are referring to the same quantity just scaled by a constant. 
Just as voltage is a fundamental quantity of electrical engineering that 
represents how difficult it is to move electrons around, chemical potential 
is fundamental quantity of chemistry that represents how difficult it is to 
move electrons around. 

13.4 Deriving the Thomas Fermi Equation 
As the electron around an atom moves, energy is converted between energy 
of the Coulomb interaction and kinetic energy of the electron. The action 
is 
ˆ 


r2 


S 
= 
Ldr 
. 
(13.71) 

r1 


The path found in nature minimizes the action. 

ˆ 
r2 


δ 
Ldr 
=0 
(13.72) 

r1 


The integral is over position, not time. In chapter 11, we called this idea 
the Principle of Least Action. Reference [136, p. 52] calls this idea in this 
context the Second Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem. To find the path, we set up 
and solve the Euler-Lagrange equation. The Euler-Lagrange equation in 

!

the case where the independent variable is a vector of the form  
r 
= 
ra^r 
instead of a scalar (with no θ 
or φ 
dependence anywhere) is given by

[176, p. 13]. 

As described above, generalized path is voltage V 
= 
V 
(r), and generalized 
potential is charge density ch 
= 
ch(r). As discussed in Chapter 
12, we could have made the opposite choice. In fact, the opposite choice 
may seem more logical because the words voltage and potential are often 
used synonymously. The same result is obtained regardless of the choice. 
However, the algebra is less messy with this choice, and this choice is more 
consistent with the literature. 

 
306 13.4 Deriving the Thomas Fermi Equation 

Next, evaluate the Euler-Lagrange equation, Eq. 13.73, using the Lagrangian 
of Eq. 13.67. The resulting equation is the equation of motion. 
Consider some of the pieces needed. The derivative of the Lagrangian with 
respect to the path is 

@L

(13.74)

@V

In Chapter 11, this quantity was defined as the generalized potential. 
Above, we defined ch 
as the generalized potential. Both @L 
and ch 
have 

@V 
units mC 
3 
. 
According to Eq. 13.60, @L 
is ch 
multiplied by a constant, and 

@V 
that constant is close to one. Since @L 
isn't equal to ch, our equations

@V 


are not completely consistent. However, the difference is small given the 
extreme assumptions made elsewhere. We also need the generalized momentum.

Equation 13.93 is called the Thomas Fermi equation. We have finished 
the derivation. The Thomas Fermi equation along with appropriate 
boundary conditions can be solved for y(t). Since the equation is nonlinear, 
numerical techniques are likely used to solve it. Once y(t) is found, Eqs. 

13.56 and 13.80 can be used to find V 
(r) 
and ch(r). From this equation of 
motion, we can find ch 
(r), where, on average, the electrons are likely to be 
found as a function of distance from the nucleus in spherical coordinates.

13.5 From Thomas Fermi Theory to Density Functional 
Theory 
The analysis considered in this chapter is based on works from 1926 to 
1928 [173] [174]. They were early attempts at calculating the location of 
electrons around an atom, and they were developed when the idea of an 
atom itself was still quite new. Half of Fermi's work is in Italian, and half 
is in German. However, it is clearer than most technical papers written in 
English. 

A calculation is called ab initio if it is from first principles while a 
calculation is called semi-empirical if some experimental data is used to 
find parameters of the solution [136, p. 13]. The Thomas Fermi method is 
the simplest ab initio solution of the calculation of the charge density and 
energy of electrons in an atom [136]. Since no experimental data is used, 
the results of the calculation can be compared to experimental data from 
spectroscopic experiments to verify the results. 

We already know that the results are not very accurate because we made 
a lot of rather extreme assumptions to make this problem manageable. 
Assumptions include: 

• 
There is no angular dependence to energy, charge density, voltage, or 
other quantities. 
• 
Temperature is near absolute zero, T 
≈ 
0 
K, so that all electrons 
occupy the lowest allowed energy states. 
• 
There is only one isolated atom with no other charged particles around 
it. 
• 
The atom is not ionized and is not part of a molecule. 
• 
The atom has many electrons, and one electron feels effects of a uniform 
cloud due to other electrons. 
• 
The electrons of the atom do not have any spin or internal angular 
momentum. 
Refined versions of this calculation are known as density functional theory. 
A function is a quantity that takes in a scalar value and returns a scalar 
value. A functional takes in a function and returns a scalar value. The 
name density functional theory comes from the fact that the Lagrangian 
and Hamiltonian are written as functionals of the charge density. Density 

 
13 THOMAS FERMI ANALYSIS 309 

functional theory calculations do not make as many or as severe of assumptions 
as were made above, especially for the Ee 
e 
interact 
term. These calculations 
have been used to calculate the angular dependence of the charge 
density, the allowed energy states of electrons that are part of molecules, 
the voltage felt by electrons at temperatures above absolute zero [136], and 
many other microscopic properties of atoms. Density functional theory is 
an active area of research. Often charge density is chosen as the generalized 
path instead of voltage [136]. 

Both Thomas [173] and Fermi [174] included numerical simulations. 
Amazingly, these calculations were performed way before computers were 
available! More recently, researchers have developed software packages for 
applying density functional theory to calculate the allowed energy levels, 
charge density, and so on of electrons around atoms and molecules [178] 
[179]. Because of the complexity of the calculations, parallel processing is 
used. Computers with multiple processors, supercomputers, and graphics 
cards with dozens of processors have all been used.

14 Lie Analysis 

14.1 Introduction 
In Chapter 11, the ideas of calculus of variations were applied to energy 
conversion processes. We began with two forms of energy and studied how 
those forms of energy varied with variation in some generalized path and 
some generalized potential. The result was an equation of motion that described 
the variation of the generalized path. The equation of motion had 
the form of conservation of generalized potential. In Chapter 12, conservation 
laws were listed in the last row of the tables. Knowing how forms of 
energy vary with path and with potential provide significant information 
about energy conversion processes. The purpose of this chapter is to show 
that we can find symmetries, invariants, and other information about the 
energy conversion process by applying Lie analysis techniques to this equation 
of motion. If continuous symmetries of an equation can be identified, 
it is often possible to extract quite a bit of information by starting only 
with the equation. 

The equations of motion that result from calculus of variations are not 
always linear. It may or may not be possible to solve a nonlinear equation of 
motion for the path. Even in the cases where it is possible, it is often quite 
difficult because techniques for solving nonlinear differential equations are 
much less developed than techniques for linear equations. Furthermore, 
many nonlinear differential equations do not have closed form solutions. In 
this chapter, we will see a systematic technique for getting information out 
of nonlinear differential equations that comes from calculus of variation. 
The technique is known as Lie analysis based on the work of Sophus Lie 
in the late part of the nineteenth century. Additionally, this chapter introduces 
Noether's theorem. Using this theorem and an equation of motion, 
we may be able to derive conserved quantities. The techniques discussed 
in this chapter apply even for nonlinear equations. 

Lie analysis is a systematic procedure for identifying continuous symmetries 
of an equation. If the equation possesses continuous symmetries, 
we may be able to find related conservation laws. Some equations possess 
multiple symmetries and conservation laws while other equations do not 
contain any symmetries or conservation laws. Using this procedure with 
a known generalized path, we may be able to derive conserved quantities 
even if we do not know how to choose the generalized potential at first. 
Some systems might even contain multiple conserved quantities, and this 
procedure will give us a complete set of conserved quantities. 

Lie analysis has been used to find continuous symmetries of many fun


 
312 14.1 Introduction 

damental equations of physics, and it has been applied to both classical and 
quantum mechanical equations. References [164, p. 117] and [181] apply 
the procedure to the heat equation 

dy 
d2y 


= 
(14.1)

dt 
dx2 
describing the function y(t, 
x). 
It has been applied to both the two dimensional 
wave equation [164, p. 123] and the three dimensional wave equation 
[181]. Other equations analyzed by this procedure include Schrödinger's 
equation [182] [183], Maxwell's equations [184] [185], and equations of nonlinear 
optics [186]. 

A tremendous amount of information can be gained by looking at the 
symmetries of equations. Knowledge of continuous symmetries may allow 
us to solve equations or at least reduce the order of differential equations 
[164]. If we can identify symmetries, we may be able to simplify or speed 
up numerical calculations by using known repetition in the form of the 
solution. If multiple equations contain the same symmetry elements, we 
can draw comparisons between the equations [164]. We may be able to 
find invariant quantities of the system from known continuous symmetries 
of equations. Hopefully this chapter will provide an appreciation for the 
amount of information that can be gained from applying symmetry analysis 
to equations of motion describing energy conversion processes. 

14.1.1 Assumptions and Notation 
The techniques of this chapter are applied to equations of motion that 
results from describing an energy conversion processes by calculus of variations. 
All starting equations of motion are assumed to have only one 
independent and one dependent variable. These equations may or may 
not be linear. Furthermore, all independent and dependent variables are 
assumed to be purely real. We made the same assumptions in Chapter 

11. Most of the examples in this chapter involve second order differential 
equations because many of the energy conversion processes studied in 
Chapter 11 led to equations of motion which were second order differential 
equations. However, these techniques apply to algebraic equations and to 
differential equations of other orders. 
In this chapter, total derivatives will be denoted as either dy 
or y_. Par


dt 
tial derivatives will be denoted as either @y 
or @ty 
for shorthand. If the

@t 


quantity y 
is just a function of a single independent variable, there is no 
reason to distinguish between total and partial derivatives, dy 
= 
@y 
. Equa


dt 
@t 


tions of motion in this chapter will involve one independent and one dependent 
variable, y(t). However, we will encounter functionals of multiple 

 
14 LIE ANALYSIS 313 

dy

independent variables such as the Lagrangian L 
= 
L(t, 
y, 
dt 
). For such 
quantities, we will have to distinguish between total and partial derivatives 
carefully. 

The analysis here is in no way mathematically rigorous. Furthermore, 
the examples in this chapter are not original. References to the literature 
are included below. 

These techniques generalize to more complicated equations. They apply 
to equations with multiple independent and multiple dependent variables, 
and they apply when these variables are complex [164]. Also, these techniques 
apply to partial differential equations as well as ordinary differential 
equations, and they even apply to systems of equations [164]. See references 
[164] for how to generalize the methods introduced in this chapter 
to the other situations. 

14.2 Types of Symmetries 
14.2.1 Discrete versus Continuous 
This chapter is concerned with identifying symmetries of equations. We 
say that an equation contains a symmetry if the solution to the equation 
is the same both before and after a symmetry transformation is applied. 
The wave equation is given by 

d2y 


+ 
!02 
y 
=0 
(14.2)

dt2 


where !0 
is a constant. When t 
represents time, !0 
has units of frequency. 
The wave equation is invariant upon the discrete symmetry 

y 
 
y~= 
y. 
(14.3) 

This transformation is a symmetry because when all y's in the equation 
are transformed, the resulting equation contains the same solutions as the 
original equation.

Symmetries can be classified as either continuous or discrete. Continuous 
symmetries can be expressed as a sum of infinitesimally small symmetries 
related by a continuous parameter. A discrete symmetry cannot 

 
314 14.2 Types of Symmetries 

be written as a sum of infinitesimal transformations in this way. Three 
commonly discussed discrete symmetry transformations [187] are: 

• 
Time reversal t 
 
t~= 
(1)n 
t 
, for integer n 
• 
Parity y 
 
y~=(1)n 
y, for integer n 
• 
Charge conjugation y 
 
y~= 
y 
∗ 
, where ∗ 
denotes complex conjugate. 
For example, the wave equation is invariant upon each of these three discrete 
symmetries because solutions of the equation remain the same before 
and after these symmetry transformations are performed. The transformation 
t 
 
t~= 
t 
+ 
", where ε 
is the continuous parameter which can be 
infinitesimally small, is an example of a continuous transformation because 
it can be separated into a sum of infinitesimal symmetries. Both discrete 
and continuous symmetries may involve transformations of the independent 
variable, the dependent variable, or both variables. In this chapter, we will 
study a systematic procedure for identifying continuous symmetries of an 
equation, and we will not consider discrete symmetries further. 

14.2.2 Regular versus Dynamical 
Continuous symmetries can be classified as regular or dynamical. Regular 
continuous symmetries involve transformations of the independent variables 
and dependent variables. Dynamical symmetries involve transformations 
of the independent variables, dependent variables, and the derivatives of 
the dependent variables [188]. (Some authors use the term generalized 
symmetries instead of dynamical symmetries [164, p. 289].) Only regular 
symmetries will be considered. The techniques discussed here generalize to 
dynamical symmetries [164], but they are beyond the scope of this text. 

14.2.3 Geometrical versus Nongeometrical 
Symmetries may also be classified as geometrical or nongeometrical [184] 
[185]. Nongeometrical symmetry transformations involve taking a Fourier 
transform, performing some transformation of the variables, then taking an 
inverse Fourier transform. The resulting transformations are symmetries 
if the solution of the equation under consideration are the same before 
and after the transformations occur. Nongeometrical symmetries can be 
written as functions of an infinitesimal parameter but are not continuous. 
Nongeometrical symmetries will not be discussed here and are also beyond 
the scope of this text.

14.3 Continuous Symmetries and Infinitesimal Generators

infinitesimal parameter ", and it may also depend on t 
and y. Furthermore, 
it is an operator meaning that it may involve derivative operations. 

We are considering only continuous symmetries, so we can study the 
behavior in the limit as ε

Taylor series in the small parameter ".

in the expansion above is called the infinitesimal generator. It 
may be separated into two components. 

U

The function ξ 
describes infinitesimal variation in the independent variable. 
The function η 
describes infinitesimal variation in the dependent variable, 
and it was introduced in Sec. 11.4. Both ξ 
and η 
may depend on both the 
independent variable and the dependent variable.

(14.19)

by Eq. 14.14, so finite transformations can be derived from infinitesimal 
generators.

While the symmetry transformation was given in this example, below we 
will see a procedure to derive infinitesimal generators for an equation. 

In general, if we know a solution to an equation and we know that a 
symmetry is present, we can derive a whole family of related solutions to

y(t)= 
c0

c1 
sin

(14.24) 

where boundary conditions determine the constants c0

tells us that

must also be a solution. Using Eq. 14.24, we have found a family of 
related solutions because Eq. 14.25 is a solution for all finite or infinitesimal 
constants ". Figure 14.1 illustrates this idea. The known solution is shown 
as a solid line. The dotted and dashed lines illustrate related solutions, 
for different constant ε 
values. We encountered the wave equation in the 
mass spring example of Section 11.5 and the capacitor inductor example 
of Section 11.6, so symmetry analysis provides information about both of 
these energy conversion processes. It tells us that if we run the energy 
conversion process and find one physical path y(t), 
then for appropriate 
boundary conditions, y(t 
+ 
") 
is also a physical path. This symmetry is 
present in all time invariant systems. Qualitatively for the mass spring 
example, it tells us that if we know the path taken by the mass when we

All linear equations, including the wave equation, contain a continuous 
symmetry transformation described by the infinitesimal generator 

U

(14.26)

finite transformation using Eq. 14.14.

The above transformation says that if we scale any solution of a linear 
equation, y(t), by a constant (1 
+ 
"), the result will also be a solution of 
the equation. By definition, a linear equation obeys exactly this property. 
By knowing a solution of the wave equation and this symmetry, we can find 
a whole family of related solutions, and this family of solutions is illustrated 
in Figure 14.2. 

The wave equation also contains the symmetry transformation described 
by the infinitesimal generator 

U

sin(!0t)@y.

The operators ξ 
and η 
can be identified directly from the infinitesimal 
generator.

finite constant, we have found another family of solutions using symmetry 
concepts, and these solutions are illustrated in Figure 14.3. 

In this section, we have discussed three of the symmetries of the wave 
equation. The wave equation actually contains eight continuous symmetry 
transformations. Deriving these transformations is left as a homework 
problem.

14.3.3 Concepts of Group Theory 
The study of symmetries of equations falls under a branch of mathematics 
called group theory. When mathematicians use the word group, they have 
something specific in mind. A group is a set of elements along with an 
operation that combines two elements. The operation is called group multiplication, 
but it may or may not be the familiar multiplication operation 
from arithmetic. To be a group, the elements and operation must obey four 
additional properties: identity, inverse, associativity, and closure [14, p. 7] 
[164, p. 14]. A group is called a Lie group if all elements are continuously 
differentiable [164, p. 14]. 

The first property of group elements is the identity property which says 
that every group must have an identity element, Xid. When the identity 
element is multiplied by any other group element, the result is that other 
element. The inverse property says that each element in the group must 
have a corresponding inverse element which is also in the group. When 
the original element is multiplied by its inverse, the result must be the 
identity element. The associative property says that the product of group 
elements (X1 
· 
X2) 
X3 
where the first two elements are multiplied first and 
the product of group elements X1 
· 
(X2 
· 
X3) 
where the last two elements

(X2

(14.37) 

The closure property says that when two elements of the group are multiplied 
together, the result is another element of the group. Table 14.1 
summarizes these properties where X1;X2, 
and X3 
are elements of the 
group, and Xid 
is the identity element which is also a member of the group. 
However, groups may have more or less than three elements. 

In general, the order in which group elements are multiplied matters.

The quantity X1

is sometimes called the commutator, 
and it is denoted [X1;X2] 
. 
Due to the closure property, the result of the 
commutator is guaranteed to be another element of the group [14, p. 21,32] 
[164, p. 39,50].

(14.39) 

Continuous symmetries of equations are described by infinitesimal generators 
that form a Lie group. The elements of the group are the infinitesimal 
generators scaled by a constant [164, p. 52]. The group multiplication 
operation is regular multiplication also possibly scaled by a constant. According 
to this definition, U 
= 
@t, U 
=2@t 
and U 
= 
10:2@t 
are all the 
same element of the group because the constant does not affect the element. 
If we find a few infinitesimal generators of a group, we may be able to use 
Eq. 14.39 to find more generators. A complete set of infinitesimal generators 
describe all possible continuous (regular geometrical) symmetries of 
the equation. All continuous (regular geometrical) symmetry operations of 
the equation can be described as linear combinations of the infinitesimal 
generators. 

 
322 14.4 Derivation of the Infinitesimal Generators 

14.4 Derivation of the Infinitesimal Generators 
14.4.1 Procedure to Find Infinitesimal Generators 
We are studying differential equations, which can be written as 

F 
(t, 
y, 
y;˙ 
:::)=0 
(14.40) 

for some function F 
. We are looking for continuous symmetries that can 
be applied to this equation such that the original equation and the transformed 
equation have the same solutions. The symmetries are denoted by 
infinitesimal generators 

U 
= 
@t 
+ 
@y 
(14.41) 

that describe how the independent variable t 
and dependent variable y 
transform. Upon a symmetry transformation, the independent variable 
and dependent variable transform, but so do the derivatives of the dependent 
variable, y_, y;¨ 
... The prolongation of an infinitesimal generator is a 
generalization of the infinitesimal generator that describes the transformation 
of the independent variable, the dependent variable, and derivatives 
of the dependent variable [164, p. 94]. 

The nth prolongation of a generator U 
is defined as 

(n)U

ttt@...

pr = 
@t 
+ 
@y 
+ 
t@y˙ 
yy

(14.42) 

and it has terms involving tn 
. 
The functions t 
and tt 
are defined [164], 

d

(η

(14.44)

dt2 
tttt

The quantities ttt 
, 
, and so on can be defined similarly, but they will 
not be needed for the examples below. The prolongation of the infinitesimal 
generator is an operator that describes the transformation of t, 
y, 
y;˙ 
y, and 
so on up to the nth derivative. Some authors [189] use the term tangential 
mapping instead of prolongation. 

The procedure to find all possible continuous symmetries of an equation 
is based on the idea that the solutions of an equation remain unchanged 
upon a symmetry operation. For a given transformation to be a symmetry 
operation, not only must all the solutions remain unchanged, but so must 
all derivatives of the solutions. Thus, for a differential equation of the form 
F 
(t, 
y, 
y;˙ 
:::)=0, 
all symmetries U 
obey the symmetry condition 

 
14 LIE ANALYSIS 323 

pr(n)UF 
=0. 
(14.45) 

We solve this symmetry condition to find all allowed infinitesimal generators 
that describe continuous symmetries of the original equation. 

We can use Eqs. 14.43 and 14.44 to write the symmetry condition in 
terms of the components of the infinitesimal generators, ξ 
and . 
Then, we 
solve the symmetry condition for ξ 
and . 
This step involves some algebra, 
but it can be accomplished with some patience and an adequate supply of 
ink and paper. 

We can solve the symmetry condition for the allowed infinitesimal generators. 
By careful solution, we find all infinitesimal generators of the 
form U 
= 
@t 
+ 
@y. This procedure gives us a systematic way to find all 
continuous symmetries of the equation. 

This technique applies to any differential equation. We are most interested 
in applying it to equations of motion that describe energy conversion 
processes. From this technique, we get information about solutions of the 
equation even when the equation of motion is nonlinear. Furthermore, in 
the Sec. 14.5 we see that we may be able to use the symmetries to find 
invariants of the equation, and invariants often have physical meaning. All 



symmetries of calculus of variations problems of the form δ 
Ldt 
=0 
are 
necessarily symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equation. However, the converse 
is not necessarily true, so not all symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange 
equation are symmetries of the integral equation [164, p. 255]. 

14.4.2 Thomas Fermi Equation Example 
As an example, we apply this procedure to the Thomas Fermi equation 

3=2 
1=2 


y= 
yt 
. 
(14.46) 

This equation was derived in Chapter 13. From the solution of this equation 
y(t), the charge density ch(r) 
of electrons around an isolated atom and 
the voltage V 
(r) 
felt by the electrons can be calculated within the, rather 
severe, assumptions specified in that chapter. The independent variable of 
the equation is a scaled version of radial position, not time. However, t 
will 
be used as the independent variable here because the procedure applies to 
equations regardless of the name of the variable. Reference [190] applies this 
procedure to a family of equations known as the Emden-Fowler equations. 
The Thomas Fermi equation is a special case of an Emden-Fowler equation, 
so the result of this example can be found in reference [190]. 

 
324 14.4 Derivation of the Infinitesimal Generators 

We would like to identify continuous symmetries of Eq. 14.46. These 
symmetries will be specified by infinitesimal generators of the form 

U 
= 
@t 
+ 
@y 
(14.47) 

where ξ 
and η 
have the form (t, 
y) 
and (t, 
y). Solutions of the equation 
satisfy 

 

3=2 
1=2 


y¨ 
 
yt 
=0. 
(14.48) 

For infinitesimal generators that describe symmetries of this equation, the 
prolongation is also zero. 

 

(n)U 
3=2 
1=2

pr y¨ 
 
yt 
=0. 
(14.49) 

Eq. 14.49 can be solved for all generators U 
corresponding to continuous 
symmetries of the Thomas Fermi equation. Eqs. 14.42 and 14.49 can be 
combined.

Eqs. 14.54, 14.55, 14.56, and 14.57 can be solved for ξ 
and . From Eq. 
14.57, @yyξ

From Eqs. 14.55 and 14.56, @yη

be satisfied by ξ

This procedure finds one regular continuous infinitesimal symmetry of 
the Thomas Fermi equation, with infinitesimal symmetry generator

(14.64) 

No other solutions can satisfy the constraints given by Eq. 14.49. Therefore, 
this equation has only one continuous symmetry.

14.4.3 Line Equation Example 
Consider another example of this procedure applied to the equation y=0. 
The solution of this equation can be found by inspection 

y(t)= 
c0t 
+ 
c1 
(14.74) 

because this is the equation of a straight line. The coefficients cn 
are constants, 
and they are different from the previous example. In this example, 
we will identify the infinitesimal generators for continuous symmetries of 
this equation, and we will find eight infinitesimal generators. The result of 
this problem appears in [191], and it is a modified version of problem 2.26 
of reference [164, p. 180]. 

Solutions of the original equation must be the same as solutions of an 
equation transformed by a continuous symmetry, and this idea is contained 
in the symmetry condition of Eq. 14.45. In this case, the original equation 
is y=0, so the prolongation of an infinitesimal generator acting on this 

 
14 LIE ANALYSIS 327 

equation must also be zero for an infinitesimal generator U 
that describes 
a continuous symmetry. 

pr(n)U 
(y)=0. 
(14.75) 

Using Eqs. 14.42, 14.43, and 14.44, we can write this symmetry condition 
in terms of ξ

case 3 with both ξ 
and η 
nonzero. 

Case 1 with η

328 14.4 Derivation of the Infinitesimal Generators 

There are three possible independent solutions for . They are ξ

U2

U3

They are η

U5

y@y 
(14.93) 

U6 
=

(14.94) 

Case 3 where both ξ 
and η 
are nonzero: From Eq. 14.79, we can write 

η 
=(c1 
+ 
c2t) 
b(y). 
(14.95) 
Here, b 
is a function of only y, not t. 
Therefore, 
@ytη 
= 
c2@yb(y) 
(14.96) 
which is not a function of t. 
From Eq. 14.82, we can write 
ξ 
=(c3 
+ 
c4y) 
g(t). 
(14.97) 
Here, g 
is a function of only t, 
not y. Therefore, 
@ytξ 
= 
c4@tg(t) 
(14.98) 
which is not a function of y. 
Now use Eq. 14.80.

The first term is not a function of t. Therefore, ξ 
is at most quadratic in 

t. So, ξ 
has the form 
 

ξ

c4y) 
c5 
+ 
c6t

Next, use Eq. 14.81. 
@yyη 
 
2c4@tg

(14.103) 
The second term is not a function of y. Therefore, η 
is at most quadratic 
in y. So, η

η 
=(c1

c2t) 
c8

Now use Eqs. 14.80 and 14.106. 

2(c2c9

(2c3c7

(2c2c9 
 
4c3c7)+ 
y 
(4c2c10 
 
4c4c7)=0 
(14.108) 

We end up with the pair of equations 

c2c9

(14.109) 
c2c10 
= 
c4c7 
(14.110) 
Next use Eqs. 14.81 and 14.102.

2(c4c6

c2c10

(14.114) 

These are the only possible solution of Eqs. 14.110 and 14.114. 

Finally, there are two possible solutions which are independent from the 
previously found solutions. We can set the coefficients of Eq. 14.113 to 1. 
The first solution is η 
= 
y2 
and ξ 
= 
yt 
corresponding to 

U7 
= 
yt@t 
+ 
y 
2@y. 
(14.115) 

For the second solution, we can set the coefficients of Eq. 14.109 to 1. The 
second solution is η 
= 
yt 
and ξ 
= 
t2 
corresponding to 

U8 
= 
t2@t 
+ 
yt@y. 
(14.116) 

At this point, we have found eight infinitesimal generators. These are all 
possible generators of continuous regular nongeometrical symmetries. 

14.5 Invariants 
14.5.1 Importance of Invariants 
Noether's theorem describes the relationship between continuous symmetries 
of an equation describing an energy conversion process and invariants 
of the system. The theorem was originally discovered by Noether around 
1918 [165] [166]. The importance of this theorem is described in the introduction 
to the English translation of the original paper [165]. "The well 
known theorem of Emmy Noether plays a role of fundamental importance 
in many branches of theoretical physics. Because it provides a straightforward 
connection between the conservation laws of a physical theory and 
the invariances of the variational integral whose Euler-Lagrange equations 
are the equations of that theory, it may be said that Noether's theorem has 
placed the Lagrangian formulation in a position of primacy. 

14.5.2 Noether's Theorem 
Consider an energy conversion process with a known Lagrangian that satis
fies an Euler-Lagrange equation. Assume that we have identified continuous 
symmetries described by infinitesimal generators. Noether's theorem 
says that there is a relationship between these continuous symmetries and 
conservation laws which say that some quantity is invariant. We would like 

 
14 LIE ANALYSIS 331 

to find the corresponding conservation laws and invariants. If we can find 
a quantity G 
that satisfies, 

dG 
dξ 


= 
pr(n)UL 
+ 
L 
, 
(14.117)

dt

then the quantity

= 
η 
+ 
L 
y˙ 
 
G 
(14.118)

dy˙ 
@y˙ 


is an invariant. For Lagrangians with units of joules, the quantity G 
also has 
units joules. In Eq. 14.117, pr(n)UL 
is the prolongation of the infinitesimal 
generator acting on the Lagrangian where prolongation was defined in Eq. 
14.42. 

14.5.3 Derivation of Noether's Theorem 
We can derive this form of Noether's theorem, and this derivation closely 
follows the clear and simplified derivation in reference [192]. This theorem 
is detailed and derived more rigorously in multiple other references [163, p. 

208] [164]. For the purpose of this derivation, assume that we begin with 
an equation of motion that is at most a second order differential equation. 
However, the ideas generalize to higher order equations too. Also, assume 
we know the corresponding Lagrangian of the form L 
= 
L 
(t, 
y, 
y_) 
. 
The 
general approach is to assume that we can find a value of G 
defined by Eq. 
14.117. We will perform some algebra on Eq. 14.117 to show that choice 
of G 
necessarily implies that Υ 
is invariant. 
Use the definition of the prolongation to write Eq. 14.117 in terms of ξ 
and . 
(n)U

pr = 
@t 
+ 
@y 
+ 
t@y˙ 
(14.119) 

For a second order differential equation, no more terms are needed because 
the Lagrangian depends on, at most, the first derivative y_. Substitute the 
prolongation acting on the Lagrangian into Eq. 14.117.

14.5.4 Line Equation Invariants Example 
Let us apply Noether's theorem to some examples. First, consider the line 
equation y=0 
which results from application of calculus of variations with 
Lagrangian 

L 
=
1 
y_2 
. 
(14.141)

2 


A continuous symmetry of this equation is described by the infinitesimal 
generator U 
= 
@y 
with ξ 
=0 
and η 
=1. The prolongation of the generator 
acting on the Lagrangian is zero. 

 

pr(n)UL 
= 
t 
y_= 
y˙ 
dη 
=0 
(14.142)

dt 


Using Eq.14.117, we see that G 
=0.

Next use Eq. 14.118 to find the invariant. 

@L 


= 
η 
= 
y˙ 
(14.144)

@y˙ 


Qualitatively, y˙ 
represents the slope of the line, so this invariant tells us 
that the slope of the solutions to the line equation must be constant. 

Another continuous symmetry of this equation is described by the infi
nitesimal generator U 
= 
t@y 
with ξ 
=0 
and η 
= 
t. We can solve for the 
prolongation of the generator acting on the Lagrangian. 

 

pr(n)UL 
= 
t 
y_= 
y˙ 
d 
(t

We can find G 
using Eq.14.117, and we can find the invariant using Eq.14.118.

=

(14.147) 

Qualitatively, this invariant represents the y-intercept of the line, so this 
invariant tells us that the y-intercept of the solution to the line equation 
must be constant. 

14.5.5 Pendulum Equation Invariants Example 
Consider the equation describing a pendulum, studied in Problem 11.8. 

The energy conversion process is described by the Lagrangian 
L 
= 
1 
m 
_y 
2 
 
mg 
cos 
y2 
(14.148) 
which corresponds to the equation of motion 
y 
= 
g 
sin 
y. 
(14.149) 

In these equations m 
represents the mass, and g 
represents the gravitational 
constants. Both m 
and g 
are assumed constant here. This equation of 
motion has only one continuous symmetry described by the infinitesimal 
generator U 
= 
@t 
with ξ 
=1 
and η 
=0. We can use Noether's theorem to 
find the corresponding invariant.

The quantity Υ 
is conserved, and it is the Hamiltonian which represents 
total energy. 

Whenever the Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on t, 
the system 
contains the continuous symmetry described by the infinitesimal generator 
U 
= 
@t. This infinitesimal generator has ξ 
=1 
and η 
=0. From Eq. 
14.117, G 
must be zero. From Eq. 14.118, the corresponding invariant has 
the form 

= 
L 
my_y˙ 
(14.158) 

which has the magnitude of the total energy (assuming t 
is time). This 
equation is equal to the Hamiltonian of Eq. 11.24. Therefore, if an equation 
of motion contains the symmetry @t, energy is conserved.

14.6 Summary 
In this chapter, a procedure to find continuous symmetries of equations 
was presented. Also, the relationship between continuous symmetries and 
invariants, known as Noether's theorem, was discussed. If we can describe 
an energy conversion process by a Lagrangian, we can use the techniques 
of calculus of variations detailed in Chapter 11 to find the equation of 
motion for the path. We can use the procedure discussed in this chapter to 
identify continuous symmetries of the equation of motion. These symmetry 
transformations are denoted by infinitesimal generators which describe how 
the independent and dependent variables transform. We also may be able 
to use Noether's theorem to find invariants of the system. We can apply 
this analysis even in cases where the equation of motion is nonlinear or 
has no closed form solution. The invariants often correspond to physical 
quantities, such as energy, momentum, or angular momentum, which are 
conserved in the system. Knowledge of invariants can help us gain insights 
into what quantities change and what quantities do not change during the 
energy conversion process under study.

Appendix C: Overloaded Terminology 

Physicists, chemists, electrical engineers, and other scientists develop their 
own notation to describe physical phenomenon. However, a single word 
may be adopted with different meanings by scientists studying different 
disciplines. In this section, some of these overloaded terms are discussed. 

In general, the term polarization means splitting into distinct opposite 
parts. In this text, two types of polarization are discussed: material polarization 
and electromagnetic polarization. If an external electric field, a 
voltage, is placed across a piece of material it will affect the material. If 
the material is at a temperature other than absolute zero, the electrons are 
in constant motion. However, the overall electron location will shift when 
the external electric field is applied. The term material polarization refers 
to the fact that when an external voltage is applied across an insulator, the 
electrons slightly displace from the nucleus, so the atom is more negatively 
charged on one end and positively charged on the other. Material polarization 
is discussed beginning in Section 2.2.1. The other use of the term 
polarization describes how electromagnetic waves vary with time as they 
propagate through space. Electromagnetic polarization specifies the direction 
of the electric field with respect to the direction of propagation of an 
electromagnetic plane wave. It is discussed in Section 4.4.4. A propagating 
electromagnetic field may be classified as linearly polarized, circularly 
polarized, or elliptically polarized. To determine the electromagnetic po




 


larization of a plane traveling wave, project the electric field E 
(t) 
onto a 
plane perpendicular to the direction that the wave is traveling. If the resulting 
projection is a straight line, the wave is said to be linearly polarized. 
If the projection is a circle, the wave is said to be circularly polarized, and 
if the projection is an ellipse, the wave is said to be elliptically polarized. 

Another overused term is inversion. Inversion symmetry is discussed 
in Section 2.3.2, and population inversion is discussed in Section 7.2.4. If a 
crystal structure looks the same upon rotation or reflection, the structure is 
said to have a symmetry. If the crystal structure looks the same after 180◦ 
rotation and inversion through the origin, the structure is said to have inversion 
symmetry. This idea is illustrated in Fig. 2.8. The term population 
inversion is defined in the context of lasers. In a laser, LED, lamp, or other 
device that converts electricity to optical energy, a pump excites electrons 
from a lower to a higher energy level. A population inversion occurs when 
more electrons of the active material are in the upper, rather than lower, 
energy level. Lasing requires a population inversion. 

The word potential is also quite overloaded. Electrical engineers sometimes 
use potential, as well as the term electromotive force, as a synonym 

 
352 Appendices 

for voltage. (As an aside, reference [6] carefully distinguishes between these 
three terms.) In this context, potential, like voltage, has the units volts. 
The term chemical potential chem 
has units of joules per atom, and it 
represents energy where the probability of finding an electron is one half. 
For a pure semiconductor, the chemical potential is in the middle of the 
energy gap. Semiconductor scientists typically use the term Fermi energy 
level Ef 
instead. These terms are discussed in Sec. 6.3.3 and 9.2.3. Voltage 
times charge is energy, so chemical potential can be thought of as a 
voltage times the charge of an electron. The term redox potential Vrp 
is 
equivalent to the term voltage used by electrical engineers, and it has the 
units volts. It was introduced in Sec. 9.2.5. It is used, typically by experimentalists, 
in discussing the voltage that develops across electrodes due 
to oxidation reduction chemical reactions. In the discussion of calculus of 
variations in Chapter 11, the idea of generalized potential was introduced. 
It is a parameter used to describe the evolution of an energy conversion 
process. Voltage and chemical potential can both be examples of generalized 
potentials. Generalized potential has units of joules over the units 
of the generalized path. The choice of the word generalized potential in 
calculus of variations follows reference [194, p.II-19]. Another related term 
is potential energy. Potential energy is a form of energy, and it is measured 
in joules. If we raise an object against gravity, we say that the object gains 
potential energy, and if we compress a spring, we say the spring gains spring 
potential energy. 

The related words capacitor, capacitance, theoretical capacity, and generalized 
capacity are used in this text. A capacitor is one of the most 
common circuit components, and capacitors are discussed in Sec. 1.6.3. A 
capacitor is a device constructed from conductors separated by a dielectric 
layer. It is specified by a capacitance C, in farads, which is a measure of 
the ability of the device to store a built up charge, hence store energy. The 
permittivity 
describes the distributed capacitance, in mF , of an insulating 
material. As discussed in Sec. 9.4.1, chemists use the related term theoretical 
capacity in a different way, as a measure of the charge stored in 
an battery or fuel cell. It is measured in coulombs or ampere hours. The 
adjective theoretical refers to the total amount of charge stored, not the 
charge that can be practically extracted. The idea of generalized capacity 
was introduced in Sec. 12.2 as the general ability to store energy. As with 
other concepts of calculus of variations, the units of generalized capacity 
depend on the choice of generalized path and generalized potential. 

Conductivity describes ability of some particles to flow. Electrical conductivity 
σ 
describes the ability of charges to flow. It was introduced in Sec. 

1.6.3 and discussed further in Sec. 8.6.2 and 9.2.1. Thermal conductivity 
 
Appendices 353 

κ 
describes the ability of heat to flow, and it was introduced in Sec. 8.6.3. 
Both of these ideas were discussed in the context of thermoelectric devices 
because understanding these devices requires the understanding of the flow 
of both electrons and heat. Example values for electrical conductivity and 
thermal conductivity are given in Table 8.4. 

While not identical, the terms wave vector and wave function are worth 
distinguishing. The term wave vector was introduced in Sec. 6.4 with the 
idea of reciprocal space. Functions such as energy or charge density can be 

!

described as varying with respect to position specified by the vector  
r 
in 
units of meters. These functions can also be described as varying with re

spect to spatial frequency specified by the wave vector k 
in units m. Wave 
function ψ 
was introduced in Section 11.7, and it is a fundamental idea of 
quantum mechanics. The wave function is a measure of the probability of 
finding an electron or other quantity in a particular state. 

Appendix D: Specific Energies 

Table 14.4 lists the specific energy of various materials and devices. These 
are representative values, not values for specific devices. Batteries by different 
manufacturers, for example, will have a range of specific energy values, 
and these values are often detailed in a datasheet. See the listed references 
for additional information on the assumptions made. Two types of values 
are listed for batteries. Both theoretical specific energy values for the chemical 
reactions and specific energy values for practical devices. The notation 
(th) indicates theoretical values while (pr) indicates practical values. NMH 
is an abbreviation for Nickel Metal Hydride batteries.
